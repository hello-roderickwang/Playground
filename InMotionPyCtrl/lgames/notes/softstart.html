If the robot and PC are already both powered on,

<h2>Power on and Login</h2>
If the PC is powered off, make sure the robot control panel is also powered
off before turning the PC on.
 <p>

You may then turn the PC on by pushing the power button on its front, and
wait for it to boot into the Linux operating system.  This will take a
minute or two, and will finally show a graphical user interface (GUI)
display that prompts for a login name and password.  The login name and
password will be supplied by your system administrator.
 <p>

<h2>Turn on the Robot</h2>
With the PC on, you may turn the robot control panel on.
You do this by turning the red power switch from the horizontal off
position to the vertical on position.  The panel fans will start
running, and green "power on" lamp will light, and the red "reset" lamp
will light.
<p>

<h2>Register the Encoders</h2>
Now you must move both links of the robot arm to register the robot's
two encoders.  As each encoder is registered, the control panel will
click quietly, there will be two quiet clicks.  If you move the arm
around some more, you will feel that dynamic braking is applying some
damped braking to the arm.
<p>

If you press the yellow "stop" button during normal robot
operation, the robot would be in this state, and you could contiue
from here to start the robot again.

<h2>Release the Brakes</h2>
Now press the red "reset" button.  It will make a loud clunk noise as
the damped brakes release.  The red light on the "reset" button will
go dark.  Now when you move the robot arm around, there will be no
damped braking, and the arm will move with very low friction.

<h2>Start the Motors</h2>
Now press the green "start" button.  This will prepare the motors to
accept command voltages.  You will hear a quiet whine from the motors
when this happens.  The green "start" button will light up.  The robot
is now ready to run.

<h2>Game selection menu </h2>
After you enter the correct password, the system will start a GUI
windowing system, which will include a toolbar along the bottom edge
of the display.  One of the buttons on this toolbar is a round green
icon that is a miniatore version of the display on the "clock" game
used for therapy and evaluation.
<p>

If you click on this green button, it will display a picture menu that
allows you to choose from a variety of graphical games.

These games include:

<ul>
<li> clock
<li> maze
<li> pick
<li> pong
<li> race
<li> squeegee
</ul>

<p>

<h2>Choosing a robot</h2>

These games work with either the planar or wrist robots.  By default,
they work with the planar.  To use the wrist, active the call to the
"use_wrist" proc (by removing the # comment character) in
/home/imt/lgames/common/local.tcl .  This gets read by
/home/imt/lgames/common/util.tcl:localize_robot , which is called by all
the clinic games.
