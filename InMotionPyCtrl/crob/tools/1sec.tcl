# example print a line in a timing loop controlled by ntickfifo.
# /dev/rtf5 is the tick fifo, it gets written every ntickfifo samples.
# if you are sampling at 200Hz, set ntickfifo to 200 to print once
# per second.

# (for this demo, run "go", then run this script,
# then use shm to adjust ntickfifo.)

# use fileevent to notify got_a_tick that the tickfifo has been written.

# note that this code is async/event-driven,
# we wait in vwait, not in gets.
