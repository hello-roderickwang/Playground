Help for dat_to_text program

dat_to_text converts a directory tree full of IMT binary (.dat)
files to plaintext (.asc) format.  The .asc format is suitable
for reading with Excel or Matlab.

dat_to_text creates a "mirror" directory structure in the current
folder.

For example, if you start in /home/imt and there was a file called:

  /home/imt/therapist/test/eval/20070314_Wed/round_dyn_2d_121409_Sb5.dat

it will write a new file called:

  /home/imt/mirror/therapist/test/eval/20070314_Wed/round_dyn_2d_121409_Sb5.asc

Usually, you want to cd to /home/imt (or wherever your home
folder is) and run $CROB_HOME/tools/dtt/dat_to_text, asking it to
convert the therapist folder.  

You need to specify that you want all files newer than X days.
If you want all files, try 9999, which is more than 25 years in
days.

Example run:

imt@imt:~$ $CROB_HOME/tools/dtt/dat_to_text 
Convert dat files to plaintext.

directory to convert: therapist
newer than X days: 9999

The dat_to_text program will start printing names of new files:

writing mirror/therapist/test/eval/20070314_Wed/round_dyn_2d_121409_Sb5.asc
writing mirror/therapist/test/eval/20070314_Wed/round_dyn_2d_121409_SWt6.asc
etc.

When it's finished, it will print --done--
