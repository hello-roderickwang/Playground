<p>
Closed loop control systems operate based on feedback from the system
that they are controlling, open loop control systems do not use
feedback.  For a familiar example, if you are heating food in a
microwave oven, if you just set the oven to run for two minutes, that
is open loop control.  If the oven has a thermometer or other sensor
that tells you when the food is heated up, that is closed loop control.
<p>

In normal operation, InMotion robots operate with closed loop control.
The forces sent to the motors are calculated based on feedback from
position sensors (and perhaps other sensors) in the robot system.  In
some cases, especially for debugging, you might want to send a force to
a robot motor without having it dependent on a sensor.  Usually, you
will want to send a fixed force to a motor.
<p>
To send fixed voltage open loop controls, set the shm variable
test_raw_torque to 1.  Then set the following variables to the desired
voltage, depending on which robot you are controlling:
.
<p>
<ul>
<li>raw_torque_volts_s
<li>raw_torque_volts_e
<p>
<li>wrist_left_test_volts
<li>wrist_right_test_volts
<li>wrist_ps_test_volts
<p>
<li>ankle_left_test_volts
<li>ankle_right_test_volts
</ul>

<p>
(raw_torque_volts_s should be renamed planar_shoulder_test_volts, but it
isn't, at least for now.)
