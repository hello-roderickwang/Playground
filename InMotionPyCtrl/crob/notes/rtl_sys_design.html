<h1>InMotion2 Robot Software System Design Overview</h1>

Mon Jun 19 17:48:03 EDT 2006

<h2>Scope</h2>

This document is an overview of the Interactive Motion Technologies
InMotion2 Robot Software System.  This document does not provide
detailed design information, but rather serves to introduce system
design concepts, as orientation for InMotion2 robot programmers and
other users.  This document describes a 2-degree-of-freedom
planar shoulder/elbow robot, but also applies to other robots in the IMT
family, including the IMT wrist, ankle, and linear robots.
<p>

<h2>What does the robot hardware look like?</h2>

The InMotion2 robot hardware consists of these hardware components:
<ul>
<li> robot arm
<li> control panel
<li> junction box
<li> PC computer and monitor(s)
<li> cabling
<li> workstation table
</ul>

You may visualize the planar robot arm with an analogy to a human arm.  Note
that the robot arm is not a prosthetic replacement for a human arm, it
is a special computer-controlled therapy/exercise machine.  The planar robot
arm has two links, corresponding to a person's upper arm and forearm.
The upper arm link and its joint are called the shoulder, the forearm
link and its joint are the elbow.  The two motors sit where the person's
body would be, each motor controlling one of the links.
At the wrist/hand endpoint of the planar robot, you may attach a
simple handle, or more complex devices, like a 3D force
sensor, a grasp force sensor, a 1D hand robot, or a 3D wrist robot.
<p>

The planar robot has two degrees of freedom, one for the shoulder and one for the
elbow.  These degrees of freedom permit the handle to travel freely in
the horizontal plane.  The top motor controls the shoulder link.
The bottom motor controls the elbow link.
<p>
In the hardware drawings in the notebook, the shoulder is axis #2,
and elbow is axis #1.

<p>

<h2>What does the software do?</h2>

The InMotion2 planar robot has two back-drivable motors, encoders for
sensing x/y position, and a force transducer for sensing forces.
The InMotion2 software system controls the robot hardware by
reading data from, and writing data to, these devices, and by allowing
robot programmers to change the control systems to suit their needs.
<p>

These hardware components are controlled through a data acquisition
(DAQ) board in the PC computer, by reading data from and writing data to
analog to digital (a/d) and digital to analog (d/a) channels on the DAQ
board.

<h2>Operating System Structure</h2>

The InMotion2 software system runs on an
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">
Ubuntu</a>
distribution running a
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">
Linux 2.6</a>
kernel, augmented with
<a href="http://www.xenomai.org/">
Xenomai</a>
real-time framework.
Xenomai provides Linux with low-latency for interrupts and
other real-time requirements by running the Linux kernel as a
subordinate task under a tiny microkernel.
<p>

Note that Ubuntu and Xenomai replace the Red Hat and RTlinux software
components that we used in earlier versions.  

Xenomai comes as a "kernel patch" to Linux.  Most of Xenomai is
separate and autonomous to Linux, but there are some Xenomai "hooks"
patched into the Linux kernel sources.  For this reason, Xenomai and
Linux sources must be version-matched, you may not use an arbitrary
version of Xenomai with an arbitrary version of Linux.  This is
relevant if you are constructing a system from basic components, IMT
provides the software system with these patches already in place.

<h2>Control Loop</h2>

Xenomai runs as a set of
<a href="http://linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Module-HOWTO/">
Linux Kernel Modules</a>
(LKMs).  In previous versions of our software, the robot control loop
was another LKM, but with Xenomai, the robot control loop runs in a
real-time-enabled user-mode process.  The control loop runs as a daemon,
that is, a program that performs a service (controlling the robot) without
being directly connected to a screen or keyboard.  A user interface 
must communicate with the control loop through a client program.
<p>

The InMotion2 robot control loop performs these tasks during each
sample period:

<ul>
<li> read data from robot sensors
<li> read data from reference sources
<li> calculate controls based on input data
<li> write control data to robot motors
<li> write data to log channels
</ul>

Other minor tasks housekeeping tasks include time measurement, error
checking, and so on.

<h2>User Mode I/O and GUI</h2>

Programs that provide reference source data, save log data, and
interact with a graphic display monitor are separate from the control
loop module code.  These are user-mode Linux programs, and they
communicate with the control loop using either real-time pipes
(replacing the previous rtfifos) which look like Linux named pipes, or
using usermode shared memory buffers (shm, replacing the previous
mbuffs), which allow user mode C programs to share one or more
memory regions.

<h2>What language do we use?</h2>

The InMotion2 control loop module is written in C, the language of the
Linux kernel.  We do not write in C++, because C++ has dynamic aspects,
such as constructor/destructor and exception handling that
sometimes have unbounded behaviors, and if their use were allowed, they
could complicate the deterministic requirements of real-time systems.
Linus Torvalds, author of Linux, has
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1fXS8-8eg-15%40gated-at.bofh.it">
posted his views on the subject of using C++ in the Linux kernel,</a>
which has some relevance to our decision to use C.
<p>

The user-mode programs (like GUIs and data sources and sinks) may be
written in C too, or they may be written in C++ or in whatever language
runs on the Linux system.  We prefer
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">
Tcl/Tk</a>, for its power and GUI capabilities.
You may wish to code your GUI in Python or Perl, or another language.
Traditional UNIX tools like sh and cat may be used, for example, to
read reference data and write log data files.

<h2>Passing Data between User and Kernel Modes</h2>

File-oriented per-sample data, like logs and references, are sent over
real-time pipes (rtpipes).  Occasional data, like a request to tell the
control loop to start or stop sampling, are sent using shared memory
buffers (shm).  Per sample data that isn't being filed, like x/y
position of the handle, used by a GUI, may be passed through
either interface.  Both rtpipes and shm may have access to all data,
you can use whichever seems more convenient.
<p>

To access shared memory from a user interface, the InMotion2 system provides a
C program called "shm" (shared memory) that allows text-mode access to
set and get variable data in the running system, so you can do it
without writing your own low-level shared memory access code.  The shm
program is also used to provide the system with initial device
calibration and stiffness and damping control values.  When the
InMotion2 robot module is loaded, you can run shm from the shell command
line and use it to read and modify InMotion2 robot data.
If you want to write your own shm access code, you may use the
source code to shm as an example.  <p>

User mode access to rtpipes is simple.  If the control loop is writing a
stream of log data, you may capture it from user-mode with a simple file
read system call, or by using a program like Linux "cat."

<h2>Data structures</h2>

<h3>Robot</h3>

The Robot data structure contains data that describe the physical
structure of the InMotion2 system.  The Robot data structure shows that
it is made up of two Motors, each of which has Attributes (like input
encoder angle, input tachometer velocity, and output torque), and each
of those has values (like raw input data value, data channel number,
calibration offset, and such).  While this tree structure makes sense
from an object-oriented point of view, the code handles motor-centered
data items as shoulder/elbow (s/e) pairs (like torques), and desk top
plane data items as x/y pairs (like positions).  Some data is in the big
C++-style Robot structure, but other data is in isolated s/e or x/y
coordinate pairs.  <p>

<h3>Ob</h3>
Miscellaneous data objects are in a data structure called Ob.

<h3>Daq</h3>
Data objects associated with the the Data Acquisition board are in the
Daq structure.  For example, raw input data from the a/d converters
(adc), raw output data to the d/a converters (dac), and input data from
the digital I/O channels (dio).  <p>

These three data structures, Robot, Ob, and Daq, are allocated as shared
memory buffers, and they are available for read and write access in both
the control loop module and user mode programs.  In the C code, the
structures are referenced by the pointers rob, ob, and daq:
<pre>
	rob-&gt;elbow.torque.xform		// elbow torque transformation
	ob-&gt;damp			// damping
	daq-&gt;adc[ ]			// raw input from A/D converter
</pre>
<p>

Data from various parts of the robot pass through the following parts
of the DAQ board:

<ul>
<li> encoders (x/y position) read dio
<li> motor torques (push motors, moving the arm) write d/a
<li> tachometers (velocity) read a/d (deprecated)
<li> force transducer (forces at the handle) read a/d
</ul>

Note that some components, like the grasp sensor, force transducer and
tachometers are optional.  If a system does not have tachometers,
velocities may be calculated by measuring the change in x/y position
over time.

<h2>User functions</h2>

The InMotion2 system uses a handy C programming idiom to allow
programmers to modify the behavior of the InMotion2 control loop without
modifying the code we deliver.  We provide a Func data structure with a
list of pointers to C functions controlling various parts of the control
loop:

<ul>
<li> read_reference
<li> compute_controls
<li> check_safety
<li> write_controls
<li> write_log
<li> write_display
</ul>

Inside the main loop, each of these functions is called using in a
wrapper function, for instance, main.c:call_compute_controls(),
that looks like this:

<pre>
void
call_compute_controls(void)
{
    if (func.compute_controls)
        func.compute_controls();
}
</pre>

The semantics here are, func.compute_controls is a pointer to a
function.  If its value is NULL, it will not be called.  If it is
non-NULL, it will be called.  It may be set to point to any
function.  So you may use our default, which we call
compute_controls_fn(), or you may write your own new control function and
assign its name to the func.compute_controls pointer, and it will be
called instead.  See: userfn.c:user_init().
You may do this without modifying the basic structure of the
control loop module code that we deliver.
