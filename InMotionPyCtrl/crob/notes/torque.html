<h1>InMotion2 Maximum Torques</h1>

<p>
IMT delivers the InMotion2 robot with calibration file settings that
allow the system to move the motors with maximum safe torque levels.
<p>
Note: When we say "safe," we mean "won't damage the machine."
Even a very low amount of force/torque on the robot motors is enough
to swing the arm hard enough to cause damage or injury, same as if you
dropped a coffee mug on your foot.  So be careful and hold on to the
manipulandum.

<p>

At the time of this writing, in the imt2.cal calibration file, we set
the maximum voltage sent to each motor to 5.0 volts.  Each voltage is
multiplied by the torque_xform, which is approximately 2.80, yielding a
maximum torque of 14.0 Nm.  The actual torque xform and offset for each
motor is calculated when the robot is built, by measuring the torque
delivered by the motor through its operating voltage range.

<p>
The motors are rated to stall at 9.65 Nm and
to take a (very short) 65 Nm maximum impulse.  If you are running the
motors under constant load, don't drive the motors above 9.65 Nm, or
3.45 volts.  In our experience, 5 volts has proven to be a good maximum.

<p>
Aside from the motors, the servos (currently) are rated at a maximum
of 9 amps continuous and 18 amps (very short) impulse.

<p>
If you set the maximum voltages (pfomax/pfotest) to greater than 5 volts,
you risk burning out the motors, servos, and other system electronics,
and you void your IMT warranty.  Please don't do that.
