<h1>IMT Logfile data format</h1>

Tue Jun 30 17:29:25 EDT 2009
<p>

IMT robot users are free to create their own formats for writing log
data.  We provide a default logfile format and logging functions that
are used in our clinical systems.
<p>

Our logfiles consist of a plain-text header followed by 8-byte
double-precision binary data in rows of samples.  The double precision
data is written in the default 8-byte floating point format used by the
Linux GNU C compiler on Intel PC systems.
<p>

Here is an example logfile text header:
<p>

<pre>
# imt log
s logheadsize 000252
s logcolumns 9
s logname /home/imt/therapist/test/therapy/20050207_Mon/oneway_rec_1_120919_Nb1.dat
s logversion 1.0
s logdate "Mon Feb 7 12:09:25 EST 2005"
s logidate 1107796165

# begin user data

# end user data

#####
(binary data would start here)
</pre>

The header can be seen as written in a simple scripting language.
Each line of the header is either blank, starts with a "#" or starts
with an "s" .
<p>

The "s" lines are "commands" which set variables to be used in log
reading programs.  The "s" lines have one variable name, prepended with
the string log, and then one value token afterward, which may contain
spaces if the token is enclosed in "double quotes." Log set variable names may
contain lower case alpha, numerics, or underscores.  "s" lines are
terminated by a newline.
<p>

Blank lines and lines starting with a "#" are comments, and are
ignored by a scripting language.
<p>

Some scripting languages (which may be used to parse headers) may do odd
things with backslashes ("\") or unmatched quotes, so beware of using
these in headers, even in comments.
<p>

This document describes the logfile and header currently written by IMT
software.  You can add additional comments and "s commands" to the
logfile without breaking existing software, for example:
<p>

<pre>
# new header fields

s log_color_of_grass green
s log_fingers_per_hand 5
s log_favorite_cowboy_yell "Yee hah!"
</pre>

Note: Most people don't change the log file header - the format
is flexible, but you must make sure that your software understands your changes.
<p>

The first line of the logfile header is always: # imt log
<p>

The other lines are usually written in the order shown, but this isn't
strictly necessary.
<p>

<h3>logheadsize</h3>
<p>

logheadsize is the size of the header in bytes, from the first character
through (and including) the newline following the ##### line.
logheadsize is specified in decimal, it is always exactly six digits,
with leading zeros.  This makes it easier to generate a variable-length
header and fill in the size of the header without knowing its length in
advance.
<p>

The log header is written before sample data is written, and it contains no
indication of the logfile length or the number of samples recorded.
<p>

<h3>logcolumns</h3>
<p>

logcolumns is the width of a sample in data items, where each data item
is eight bytes.  So if logcolumns is 9, each sample is 9 times 8, or 72
bytes.
<p>

<h3>logname</h3>
<p>

logname is the full path name of the logfile saved on the Linux system.
The full path name indicates a file name stored in a Linux directory
tree.  Linux full path names may not contain spaces, they consist of
alphanumerics, slash, underscore, and dot.  Slash is the directory
separator, backslash is not used for this purpose on Linux systems.
Linux file names are case-sensitive, upper and lower case characters may
not be interchanged.
<p>

The full path name:
<p>

/home/imt/therapist/test/therapy/20050207_Mon/oneway_rec_1_120919_Nb1.dat
<p>

indicates the following:
<p>

The base directory where patient data is stored is: /home/imt/therapist
<p>

The ID of the patient: test
<br>
In a clinical protocol would usually be a numeric ID, for HIPAA/privacy
reasons.
<p>

Which type of game: therapy
Usually therapy or eval.
<p>

Date: 20050207_Mon
The date when the game was started.  Monday, February 7, 2005.
<p>

File name: oneway_rec_1_120919_Nb1.dat
<p>

The file name itself can contain different information, depending on
which protocol game is being run.  One Way Record is a clock-style game,
where a patient moves a planar robot in a star pattern, and the logfile
records a single linear path segment per file.  The intended direction
of this path is indicated in the file name.  Other games may record
other information in the file name.
<p>

The leading component of the file name indicates the type of game, in
this case, oneway_rec indicates a One Way Record game.
<p>

The next 1 indicates that this is the first run in this part of the
protocol, which may call for several runs.
<p>

120919 indicates 12:09:19 PM, where hours are specified from 00 to
23.  The date and time are in the local timezone of the recording
system.
<p>

Nb1 means that this path moves from north (N) back (b) toward the center
of the clock display, and is the 1st path segment of a game.  If it said
SWt35 that would indicate from center toward (t) southwest (SW), and
that it is the 35th path segment of a game.
<p>

These logfiles are usually named with a .dat suffix.  When converting a
.dat file to plain-text, name the new ASCII file with a .asc suffix.
<p>

<h3>logversion</h3>
<p>

The current logfile version is 1.0, this is recorded, but currently unused.
<p>

<h3>logdate</h3>
<p>

This string indicates the time and date at the start of the path
segment.  The string is "quoted" because it contains spaces.
"Mon Feb 7 12:09:25 EST 2005"
<p>

<h3>logidate</h3>
<p>

This is an integer representation of the logdate date/time, in UNIX date
format, seconds since the UNIX epoch, January 1, 1970 midnight UTC.
1107796165
<p>

Note the difference between the time in logdate and the time in logname.
The date and time in logdate indicate the time that the logfile for that
segment was created.  The date and time in logname indicate the time
that the entire game was started.
<p>

If you start a game at 1:45:00 PM, and it requires the patient to draw
16 path segments, and each path segment takes 5 seconds, all the file
names will have the logname time 134500, but the logdate times will be
13:45:00, 13:45:05, 13:45:10, etc.  This makes it easier to group
related logfiles.  If this wasn't done, the logfiles from one game
could even spill into two directories, if you started it before midnight
and ended it after midnight.
<p>

<h3>End of header</h3>
The rest of the header consists of a begin/end pair, in case you
wanted to add some of your own ASCII data.  This is currently unused.
<p>

<pre>
# begin user data

# end user data

#####
</pre>
<p>

At the end of the header, there is a line containing ##### followed by a
newline.  The logheadsize counts the header from its first character, up
to and including the newline following the five #'s.
<p>

If the logheadsize is 000252, if the first character of header data is
at address 0, the first character of binary data is at address 252.
<p>


<h3>Format of binary data</h3>
<p>

Binary data following the header is written by logging functions which
may be specified by the designer of the software game.  In IMT's
clinical protocol for our planar robot, we use the following C code to
create a log record:
<p>

<h3>Default Planar Log</h3>
<pre>
{
    ob->log[j++] = (f64) ob->i;
    ob->log[j++] = ob->pos.x;
    ob->log[j++] = ob->pos.y;

    ob->log[j++] = ob->vel.x;
    ob->log[j++] = ob->vel.y;

    ob->log[j++] = rob->ft.world.x;
    ob->log[j++] = rob->ft.world.y;
    ob->log[j++] = rob->ft.world.z;

    ob->log[j++] = rob->grasp.force;
}
</pre>
<p>

This code causes the following data to be recorded, the number on the
left is a column number, where each column is an eight-byte double
precision quantity.
<p>

<pre>
0: tick number

1: planar robot X position in meters
2: planar robot Y position in meters

3: planar robot X velocity in meters per second
4: planar robot Y velocity in meters per second

5: planar robot X force in newtons
6: planar robot Y force in newtons
7: planar robot Z force in newtons

8: planar robot grasp force in newtons
</pre>
<p>

The tick number represents the number of clock ticks, incremented at 200
per second if you are collecting data at 200 Hz, since the robot
software was started, or since the tick count was reset.  This number
will not be zero for the first logfile sample. 
<p>

This number is an integral value in a floating point variable, usually
increasing at one unit per sample.  A game could start and stop logging
data during the writing of a single log file, which could cause a jump
in the tick value, but this is not usually done.
<p>

If the planar robot does not collect grasp data, the grasp column is
present but its contents are undefined.
<p>

Planar logfile data is recorded in the world space coordinates of the
workstation tabletop.  The position origin (0,0) is usually set at a Y
position offset -0.65 meters from the center of the robot body, that is,
so it is in the middle of the tabletop.
<p>

Offsets in X position may also be used to accommodate the fact that a
patient is not seated directly in front of the robot, but the X position
offset is usually zero.
<p>

The planar robot coordinate system is a Cartesian plane.  When sitting
in the workstation chair, +X is to the right, and +Y is toward the
robot.  For forces, -Z is up and +Z is down.
<p>

<h3>Default Wrist Log</h3>

Wrist logfiles have 11 columns, and are specified this way:
<p>

<pre>
{
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = (f64) ob-&gt;i;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.pos.fe;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.pos.aa;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.pos.ps;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.fvel.fe;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.fvel.aa;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.fvel.ps;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.moment_cmd.fe;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.moment_cmd.aa;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;wrist.moment_cmd.ps;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = rob-&gt;grasp.force;

}
</pre>
<p>

<pre>
0: tick number

1: wrist robot FE position in radians
2: wrist robot AA position in radians
3: wrist robot PS position in radians

4: wrist robot FE velocity in radians per second
5: wrist robot AA velocity in radians per second
6: wrist robot PS velocity in radians per second

7: wrist robot FE moment in newton meters
8: wrist robot AA moment in newton meters
9: wrist robot PS moment in newton meters

</pre>
<p>

Wrist data is recorded with respect to the the degrees of freedom of the
wrist:
<p>

<pre>
FE: flexion and extension
AA: abduction and adduction
PS: pronation and supination
</pre>
