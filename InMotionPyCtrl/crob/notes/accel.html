The Analog Devices ADXL 105EM-3 3-axis accelerometer returns
accelerations in X, Y and Z.  It returns an analog voltage between 0
and 5 volts.  It is attached to the junction box using the connector
labeled CN10.  This connector generates inputs on AIN0, AIN1, and AIN2
(ADC channels 8, 9, and 10), so if you use the accelerometer, you must
be sure that those inputs are not terminated on the junction box,
and that they are not connected to other devices.
 <p>

An accelerometer measures "deviation from free fall." Einstein
hypothesized that it is not possible to distinguish between
accelerations of the reference frame and being in a gravitational
field.  So an accelerometer at rest on a table will register 1G.
<p>

The accelerometer comes with calibration data, but you may also
calibrate it yourself.  You do this by measuring its response to
gravity when at rest.  Measure the output voltage with the
accelerometer package on a flat surface (horizontal with respect to
gravity) with X, Y, and Z both up and down (six readings).  These will
provide 1G and -1G readings for each of the three axes.  You may
calculate the 0G reading by averaging the two, and the 1G reading for
each dimension by subtracting the -1G from the 1G reading and dividing
by 2.
 <p>

The average reading for each dimension is its bias, and the average 1G
voltage reading is the xform.  Typically, the bias readings (0G) will be
about 2.5 volts, and the xform will be about .5 volts per G.  So it
will read about 3 volts when rightside up, and about 2 volts when
upside down.
