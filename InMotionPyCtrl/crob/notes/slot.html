<h2> What is a Slot Controller?</h2>
A slot controller is a C language function called by the robot's Linux Kernel
Module main loop that controls the InMotion2 motor torques based on robot state
data like current x/y position, torque, velocity, stiffness and damping, time,
and the position of virtual objects in world space, some of which we call slots.
<p>
This note describes slot controllers in some detail, if you want to
learn how to call one before you understand how it actually works,
scroll down to
<a href="#starting">Starting a Slot Controller from a User Mode Program</a>
below.
<p>

Often, you want the patient to move the manipulandum from position A to B in a
straight line path, so you want to set up a slot control such that when the
manipulandum strays from this path, the motors draw the manipulandum back
toward the path, and perhaps, also toward the destination.  The InMotion2 Slot
control code provides a framework for setting up such slots.
<p>

Besides the typical slot path, you might want to use a slot controller to
create other virtual objects in the world space.  Maybe you want an object that
behaves like:

<ul>
<li> a pinball bumper that pushes you away when you hit it
<li> a tar-pit that applies drag when you go through it
<li> a planet that attracts you with stronger gravity the closer you get to it
<li> a surrounding wall that keeps you from moving outside boundaries on the workstation tabletop
</ul>

These aren't really slots, but programming their behavior is similar to
programming a slot path.
 <p>

We provide a "star" example that works by moving the manipulandum through a
series of straight-line slots, from the center of the display out to and back
from each of 8 compass points.
<p>

Note the time component of a slot - if you are going from position A to
B, at any point in time a slot might be:

<ul>
<li> a line or box between those positions
<li> a point moving from position A to B
<li>a line or box collapsing (and pushing) from behind as time progresses
</ul>

depending on how you want the slot to behave.  This is all assuming that the
slot is trying to help the patient reach the destination.  It could also be
programmed to work against the patient's destination goal if it is desired to
make the patient's task more challenging.

<p>

InMotion2 programmers will write different slot controllers based on the
particular requirements of experiments or therapies.  The robot software
provides an api so that the slot controller can get parameters it needs to
function, like start and stop conditions for time and position.

<h2> Program a slot controller</h2>
<p>
The slot control code consists of slot controllers themselves, and the
code to manage them.  Slot controllers dictate the torques applied to
the robot's motors so that forces are applied to manipulandum, making
the robot arm move in different directions while feeling stiff,
springy, etc. in the patient's hand.

<p>
Slot controllers base their
behaviors on various inputs.  Some inputs are from the robots system's
current or recent state - the X/Y position, tachometer velocity,
torques currently being applied to the motors, and so forth.
<p>
In addition to this robot state, slot controllers can get further
state information from slot control infrastructure.  For instance,
let's say you have a compass face on the tabletop, centered at 0.0,
0.0, and with compass points 0.2 meters in eight directions, north, ne, east,
se, south, sw, west and nw, and you want to run a slot with the following
attributes:

<ul>
<li> manipulandum starting at the center (0.0,0.0)
<li> finishing at east (0.2,0.0)
<li> traveling in a fixed size box .004 meters wide and .003 meters tall
<li> start the slot immediately, at time i = 0
<li> finish the slot in 2 seconds, at time i = 2*Hz samples
<li> increment the time i one tick per sample
<li> identify this slot as "id 0" - there are 8 to choose from, 0-7
<li> invoke the slot function at index 0 - you can create an array of
pointers to your different slot functions
</ul>

There is no C function to set up a slot.  You fill ob-&gt;copy_slot
with the parameters it needs, then you set ob-&gt;copy_slot.go to 1,
and it gets copied into the right place during the next sample.
<p>

The slot management code is in slot.c, the main function is called
do_slot().  This isn't the slot controller code itself, this is the
code that decides when to call each slot controller.  During each
sample, do_slot iterates through the slot array and checks to see if
there are active slots.  For each slot that is active, it increments
the slot time counter, using a for-loop style structure - initial
value, increment, and terminal value.
 <p>

The only dynamic variable that do_slot changes from sample to sample
is the current time value.  The slot controller itself takes this
variable i, plus all the fixed values for initial and terminal time,
and initial and terminal box position, and calculates the current
position of the slot.
<p>

Once the box/slot position for the current iteration is set, the slot
controller uses that information, with other control information, such
as stiffness and damping information inside and outside the current
box, to calculate torques to apply to the motors, to provide proper
force feedback to the patient.
<p>

The slot management code includes functions stop_slot(id) that stops
slot # id, and stop_all_slots, that stops all the slots.

<h2>When is a slot done?</h2>
A subtle and important question about managing slot controllers is how
to deal with the smooth transfer of control from one slot controller to
another.  In a simple case, when a slot controller finishes processing,
it might invoke a new slot controller, in daisy chain fashion.  That
termination may come after a fixed time period, or perhaps after an
event causes a "done" variable to be set.
<p>
What if a slot controller "stops" before a new slot controller takes
control?  Let's say we have a loop where the manipulandum is moving
back and forth between points A and B.  The slot controller takes 3
seconds to go from A to B, after which it terminates.  After two more
seconds. a new slot makes the return trip - 3 seconds of travel, then
another two seconds of rest.
<p>

When you ask a slot controller manager to run for 3 seconds, when it
hits its termination condition, it will not really stop running the
slot until you zero it out, it will just keep holding on to its final
position and slot control settings.  So in this example, it would move
the manipulandum for 3 seconds and hold it in the final position for
2 seconds - probably the behavior that you want.  If instead of
holding the final position, you wanted to apply zero torques to the
motors, you could do that by zeroing out the slot when it terminated,
instead of letting it run until it was superseded by a new slot.
<p>

In most cases you design the task so that the actual point is near the
desired point at the end of a slot (when the user hits the target, the
motor forces will be low).  But if the motors are applying large
forces to the manipulandum and you want to stop a slot, you can
prevent the jarring effect of suddenly zeroing out a conrtrolled force
by ramping the stiffness down to zero over a short period (half a
second or a second).  This will provide a gentler experience for the
user.

<h2><a name="starting">
Starting a Slot Controller from a User Mode Program</a></h2>
The text above notes that there is no C code for invoking a slot
controller - you start it by filling a data structure with the right
parameters.  The robot software Tcl library provides a function called
movebox that starts a slot controller by filling this data structure.
It's called movebox because in typical use, it
has the effect of moving a box-shaped slot from a source to a
destination point.  movebox can move a point, a small box, or a slot of
changing size that can act like a collapsing or expanding slot or box.
Note: see <a href="#ccmc">Concurrent movebox calls</a> below.
<p>

A typical call to movebox, moving a reference point horizontally from
the origin to a position 10 cm to the right, look like this:

<p>
<pre>
# slotid/fnid  loop       frombox            tobox
  movebox 0 0 {0 1000 1} {0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0}  {0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0}
</pre>
<h3>slotid and fnid</h3>
<p>
slotid identifies your slot if you have more than one slot
active at once.  If you have one slot, slotid should be zero.
You'll need more than one slot if you are controlling more than
two dimensions, like if you have an integrated planar/wrist robot.
<p>
fnid is the slot function id.  Slot functions are stored in the *_uslot.c
files - pl_uslot.c for planar slot functions, wr_uslot.c for wrist slot
functions, etc.  The u in pl_uslot.c stands for user, because research
users will add their own slot functions to these files.  A list of
pointers to all slot functions is stored in ob-&gt;slot_fns[], which is
managed in pl_uslot.c:init_slot_fns[].  When you add a new slot
function, you add a declaration of your function to the list of declared
functions, and an array entry in init_slot_fns.  (ob-&gt;slot_fns is
currently 32 entries long in robdecls.h, if you need more, make it
bigger and recompile.)  fnid is the numeric index into ob-&gt;slot_fns.  If
you are using simple_ctl(), the planar slot function stored at
ob-&gt;slot_fns[0] when we deliver the software, then fnid will be
0.
<p>
<h3>loop</h3>
The three loop parameters are like those of a C for-loop: initial,
terminal, and increment.  To run a slot for five seconds,
using a 200 Hz sample frequency, the loop would run for 1000 samples,
and the loop parameters would be {0 1000 1} - that is, from zero through
1000 with the counter incremented once per sample.  The equivalent in C
would be: for (i=0; i<1000; i++)
<p>
The incremented value i is passed to your controller, so that it can react
as a function of time.  Assume for a moment, a one-dimensional space
(like the edge of a ruler), and you are moving at constant speed from a source
position at 0 cm to a destination at 5 cm.  If this motion takes 5 seconds
at 200 Hz, that's 1000 samples.
<ul>
<li> When the i value is 0/1000, the
reference point is at the source position.
<li>When i == 500, i is at 500/1000 and the reference point
is halfway between the source and destination position.
<li> When the i value is 1000/1000, the
reference point is at the destination position.
</ul>
<p>
Note that the controller doesn't force the robot arm to the reference point,
it just pulls the arm toward that position, with forces depending on how
the controller is coded, and usually utilizing a combination of
stiffness and damping constants, position and velocity sensor readings,
and other inputs and algorithms.
<p>
You may run a slot controller in an infinite loop by specifying a zero
increment, that is, with a loop parameter: {0 1 0}.  This wouldn't make
sense if you wanted to move a reference point from a source to a
destination, but if your controller does not need a moving reference
point, this can be useful.  Such cases include a controller with a fixed
reference point (a spring anchored to a single point) or a controller
that imposes a field with damp or curl forces that do not change as a
function of time.

<p>
<h3>frombox and tobox</h3>
The from box and to box are each described by a list of four numbers, those
are the x and y coordinates and the width and height of the box.
A box that is 2 cm wide and 1 cm tall, starting centered at (0.0,0.0)
and ending 10 cm to the right, would be programmed with these boxes:
{0.0 0.0 .02 .01} {0.10 0.0 .02 .01}
A vertical slot (with width and no height) that started 10 cm wide, between (0.0,0.0) and (0.10,0.0)
and collapsed to a point ending at the position (0.10,0.0) would be programmed with:
{0.05 0.0 0.10 0.0} {0.10 0.0 0.0 0.0}.
0.05 being the x center of the initial slot that is 10 cm wide.
<p>
Note that box parameters are simply passed into your slot controller,
the controller software can choose to use them as it wishes.  This note describes using the
parameters as x, y, width and height, as used in pl_uslot.c:simple_ctl,
which we deliver in fnid 0.  You might want to pass in other parameters,
a rotation, perhaps, or alter your code to pass in additional
parameters.
<p>
We provide an example of a controller that moves a reference point based
on a user-supplied function, see crob/examples/drawfn.tcl and
pl_uslot.c:planar_fn_ctl(), which moves the reference point by calling
pl_i_ref_fn() with parameters that move it in a circle around the origin.

<h2>tools/mvbox.tcl</h2>
mvbox.tcl is a tool for experimenting with slot controllers.
Its GUI looks like this:

<p>
<pre>
move type: ___ time: ___
src x: ___ y: ___ w: ___ h: ___
dst x: ___ y: ___ w: ___ h: ___
[go] [go back] [oscillate] [show]
[center] stop[] [quit]
</pre>
<p>

It prompts with a screen that allows you to enter variables for move
type (fnid), time (in seconds, not samples), and source and destination
boxes (in meters).  You can then hit [go] to go from the source to
destination, and then [go back] to return from destination to source.
[oscillate] goes between the source and dests points in a loop
if you want to stop the running slot, hit the stop checkbox.
[show] prints the movebox command that it generates, to give you an idea
of what it's doing.

<h2>Multiple Slots</h2>
<p>
The planar robot only requires a single two-dimensional slot at once.
Controlling a more complex robot requires more slots, one slot per each 2d pair.
An integrated
planarwrist robot requires a 2d slot to control the planar component,
another slot to control the fe (flexion/extension) and aa (abduction/adduction),
and a third slot to control the ps (pronation/supination).
You can control all these at once, using different slot id's.
<p>
You should assign a slot id to each 2d pair and stick with it, for instance,
use slot 0 for all your planar slots, slot 1 for wrist fe/aa, and slot 2 for
wrist ps.
<p>
If you have an integrated planarwrist robot, you can run two slots at once with
the mvbox.tcl program.
 <p>

<h2>Concurrent movebox calls</h2>
As noted above, the movebox proc copies a set of slot parameters into
the robot control loop.  The control loop runs at a sampling
frequency, usually 200 Hz.  This means that if you call movebox twice
within 5 ms, you could overwrite the "copy slot" buffer from the first call
with the second call, if there was no attention in the software for
this problem.
<p>
In the case of a Tcl/Tk program with a a GUI, there is an event loop
that allows Tcl to schedule events to occur in the future.
movebox checks to see if a previous movebox call has completed,
if two movebox calls happen in rapid succession,
and the first one has not completed, it reschedules
the new call to occur in 10 ms, by which time the movebox "copy slot" buffer
should be available for the second call.
<p>
This <b>only</b> works if you have an event loop, which will be the case if you are running the Tk GUI library, but will not be happening if you are only 
running Tcl in a text window without a GUI.  If you need to do concurrent movebox calls in a text Tcl program, use the Tcl vwait proc, which allows you to
set up your own event loop.
<p>
It is possible to fix this software problem with different moveboxes sharing
the same copy slot (by recoding to give each slotid its own copy slot), but at
this time (late 2006), there is still just one shared copy slot.
