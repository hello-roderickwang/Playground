(It's pronounced "tickle-tee-kay".)
Here are some links to Tcl/Tk starting points around the web, compiled by IMT.
<p>
<a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/">The Tcler's Wiki</a>
is a collaboratively edited web site with lots of information on Tcl.
Note the item about searching the wiki in the first list of bullet items, where it says: "Looking for something specific?"
<p>

After reading the Wiki home page, you might want to try these Wiki links:

<ul>
<p>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/299">What is Tcl?</a>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/487">What is Tk?</a>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/298">Beginning Tcl</a>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/969">Arts and Crafts of Tcl Programming</a>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/300">Show me an Example</a>
<li><a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/tcl/8368">Common questions about Tcl</a>
</ul>

Brent Welch's
<a href="http://www.beedub.com/book/">Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk</a>
is a good reference book.  The 3rd edition is from 1999, and is still
quite relevant, especially when augmented with the web references above.
 The 4th edition is coming soon.

<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/Tcl.htm">
Tcl's syntax</a>
is simpler and different from that of computer languages.  It is based on only
11 rules.  This simplicity makes Tcl behave in ways that are surprising to
programmers used to languages like C or Perl.  Tcl has

<ul>
<li># for comments (only where Tcl expects a command name)
<li>{ for lists (and in effect, for command block structure)
<li>$ for variable name substitution (not dereferencing)
<li>() for arrays (associative, like Perl hashes)
<li>command names (none of which are reserved)
</ul>

None of them behaves exactly the way you might be used to.  Eventually, you
will realize that it's all good and consistent, but you can't assume that Tcl
works like C or Perl or shell.  Understanding the 11 syntax rules is the key to understanding Tcl.
