We are using the Matrox 450 dual-head graphics board under Linux.

Red Hat 7.3 6/2002 comes with xfree86 4.2.0, which supports it, but it
does not support the dual-head features fully.
(Find the xfree86 version with xdpyinfo, see: vendor release number.)

You can download the latest Matrox Linux drivers from:

	http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/latest/home.cfm
	http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_200.cfm

(I installed the 2.0 beta, there was a 2.1 beta too, and later ones may
work.)

Download both the driver and the MGA PowerDesk setup utility.
The binary versions work fine.
Follow the instructions in the readme,

After installing the device driver, you can run the PowerDesk utility
(mgapdesk) to set various dual-head modes, including single head, cloned
heads, separate heads or merged heads.
