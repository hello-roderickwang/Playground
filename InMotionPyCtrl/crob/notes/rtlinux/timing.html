<h1>Timing in the InMotion2 LKM</h1>
Thu Sep  9 19:04:34 EDT 2004
<p>
The InMotion2 LKM (Linux Kernel Module) has a control loop managed by the
RTLinux real-time system.  The control loop sampling period is, by
default, 200 Hz (200 times per second).  This means that every
1/200th of a second (.005 second, or 5 ms (milliseconds)), RTLinux wakes up
the InMotion2 LKM and tells it to do its work.  (When this document
says 5 ms, it's assuming the default sampling period, if you use
a different sampling period, this length would change.)
<p>

The LKM measures and records timing information to make sure
that it is running properly.  A sample period of the control loop
starts when RTLinux wakes up the LKM.  The LKM does its work,
and then it goes to
sleep, waiting for the next signal to wake up.  Here is a graphical
representation of a few sample periods:
<p>
<pre>
|work|----------sleep----------|
|work-|---------sleep----------|
|work|----------sleep----------|
|work|----------sleep----------|
|work-|---------sleep----------|
</pre>
<p>

As noted above, each sample period (work plus sleep)
should take exactly 5 ms.  The work part
of this period should take much less than 10% of this time - most of
the sample period should be spent sleeping, which gives the rest of the Linux
system time to run.  As shown, there is sometimes slight variation in
the actual time that the work takes to complete, but this variation
should be minimal and should not have a negative effect on real-time
performance.
<p>

The LKM records timings at the transition points of each sample
period:

<pre>
|work|----------sleep----------|
^    ^                         ^
B    E                         B
</pre>

In this diagram, <b>B</b> is the beginning of the sample, which occurs when
RTLinux wakes up the LKM, in the code this is called
<b>time_before_sample</b>.  Notice that the beginning of the current
work period is the same time as the end of the previous sleep period.
<b>E</b> is the end of the work part of the sample period, in the code
this is called <b>time_after_sample</b>.

<p>
At the beginning of sampling, the start time is recorded so that
timing calculations may be done relative to the beginning of the run, this is
called <b>time_at_start</b>.
Timings are kept for the current sample and the previous (last) sample,
so that differences may be calculated between them.
These times are recorded as hrtime (high resolution time) values, which
are 64-bit integer nanosecond quantities.
<p>
Here are the main time values that are recorded:

<ul>
<li>time_at_start: recorded once at start of all sampling
<li>time_before_sample: time at start of current work period
<li>time_before_last_sample: previous time_before_sample
<li>time_after_sample: time at end of current work period
<li>time_after_last_sample: previous time_after_sample
<p>
<li>time_delta_sample: time_after_sample - time_before_sample
<li>time_delta_tick: time_before_sample - time_before_last_sample
<li>time_since_start: time_before_sample - time_at_start
</ul>

These time values are managed in main.c, in the timing functions
do_time_before_sample() and do_time_after_sample().
<p>

At the beginning of the work part of the sample (B), the system sets a
condition flag called <b>busy</b>.  When the work is done (E), busy is
cleared.  The system should never be busy at the start of a work period,
this would indicate that the previous sample's work took much too long, and
never finished.
This condition would also indicate that time_delta_sample
(E-B)
is greater than
the sampling rate (5 ms).
<p>
The system sets warning flags if time_delta_tick or time_delta_sample
go out of bounds of certain thresholds, even if this does not cause a
full error condition.  Check the timing functions in main.c to
understand the details.

<h2>Thresholds</h2>
There are several error checks performed by the main loop, mostly
looking for timing errors.  Remember the picture of a sample time, 
in the code, "work" is called sample, "work+sleep" is called tick.

<p>
<pre>
|work|----------sleep----------|
</pre>
<p>

<ul>
<li> 1 ERR_MAIN_LATE_TICK - in main.c:check_late(), a new tick started
before an old tick finished.  This is not good.
<li> 2 WARN_MAIN_SLOW_TICK - in main.c:check_late(), a tick took
longer than the delta_tick_threshold.  This may just mean that the
tick threshold is too low.
<li> 3 WARN_MAIN_SLOW_SAMPLE - in main.c:do_time_after_sample(), a sample took
longer than the delta_sample_threshold.  This may just mean that the
sample threshold is too low.
<li> 4 ERR_UEI_NSAMPLES - in uei.c:uei_ain_read(), we tried to read
some analog input samples, and the board return all that we asked for.
This probably means that we are sampling too fast for the number of samples
that we're asking for.
<li> 5 ERR_UEI_RET - in uei.c:uei_ain_read(), 
we tried to read some analog input samples, and the read call
returned an error code.  
<li> 6 ERR_UEI_BOARD_RANGE - in uei.c, you are trying to read from a
board that isn't there.  probably a bad board or channel id in
imt2.cal.
</ul>
Note that ERR is more severe than WARN.
There is a series of variables that you can watch to see if these
errors (or warnings) are occurring.  
<ul>
<li> nerrors - gets incremented every time one of the above errors
(or warnings) occurs.
<li>errori - an array, gets filled with the value of ob->i for the most
recent error.
<li>errorcode - an array, gets filled with the most recent error code
(frin 1 though six, as above)
<li>errornum - an index into both errori and errorcode, which points
to the most recent error.  the arrays are 128 entries long, when they
fill up, they wrap back to the top, so errornum will be between 0 and
127.
</ul>
Usually, if you have these kinds of errors, they will come every
sample, and "nerrors" will be incremented each sample time.  (When it
rains, it pours.)  If you get these kinds of errors, you might be
sampling at too high a frequency or you might be doing too much
oversampling (of digital or analog inputs).
<p>
If you sample at 200Hz, you should be able to get away with 5x oversampling
of ain and dio.  1000Hz is 5 times as much work as 200Hz, so you might
have to raise thresholds, and check your timings.
<p>
The important timings to check are time_ns_delta_sample and
time_ns_delta_tick.  The delta sample time depends on the CPU speed
and how much code you execute during a sample.  The delta tick time
should be close to the theoretical value (5,000,000 ns at
200Hz, 1,000,000 ns at 1000 Hz, and so on.)
<p>
The two threshold values, 
time_ns_delta_sample_thresh and time_ns_delta_tick_thresh
may need to be adjusted if you are not running at 200 Hz.
Note that both of these threshold values are with resepct to the tick
time in ns.  So if your desired tick is 5 million ns, and the sample
threshold is 10 (%), the slow sample warning will fire if the sample
takes longer than 500 thousand ns.  If the tick threshold is 120 (%),
the slow tick warning will fire if the actual tick takes longer than 6
million ns.
<p>
When these errors/warnings occur, the control loop writes messages to
an output fifo.  You may read this fifo with the program
~imt/crob/iofifo.  The error messages will reflect the errors above,
and you may look at the source code for more details on exactly what
conditions cause them.

<h2>Jitter</h2>
The variable, time_delta_tick,
reflects the accuracy of the wakeup signals from the
RTLinux system.  When RTLinux is running properly, this should be 5
ms, with very little variation.  Variation in the frequency of these
wakeup signals is known as <b>jitter</b>, and may be caused by
problems in the Linux/RTLinux operating system, outside the InMotion2
LKM.  
<p>
These problems will usually be caused by having,
in the RTLinux-enhanced Linux kernel,
a device driver or other kernel module that is compiled without the 
RTLinux enhancements.  A module that is compiled "without RTLinux
turned on" will not follow the RTLinux rules, and will not give up the
CPU when RTLinux wants it to.  This can make RTLinux code wait too
long for the CPU, causing jitter.  Note that this is not a problem in
normal user-mode programs, which are under control of the RTLinux-enhanced
Linux.  The "compile with RTLinux turned on" rule
only applies to the Linux kernel and Linux kernel modules.
