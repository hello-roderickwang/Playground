<h2>Writing Log Data</h2>
Wed Aug  4 16:34:20 EDT 2004
<p>
This document describes the process of writing data to a logfile using
the InMotion2 system.
<p>

<h2>Kernel Side - new way</h2>
(This changed in August, 2004.) In the old code, you wrote a logging function
and then pointed to it in userfn.c like so:

	func.write_log = write_data_fifo_sample_fn;

The trouble with this is that every time you want to change logging functions,
you must edit the userfn.c:user_init function and recompile.
<p>

In the new style, you keep an array of pointers to logging functions
(similar to the array of slot functions), and you choose a logging
function by selecting the index into the ob-&gt;log_fns[] array.
<p>

What used to be called userfn.c has been split into ulog.c (for
user-written logging functions) and uslot.c (for user-written slot
controller functions).
<p>

Let's say that ulog.c has these log_fns set up:

<pre>
void
init_log_fns(void)
{
	ob-&gt;log_fns[0] =  write_data_fifo_sample_fn;
	ob-&gt;log_fns[1] =  write_motor_test_fifo_sample_fn;
	ob-&gt;log_fns[2] =  write_fancy_fifo_sample_fn;
	...
}
</pre>
If you want to use write_fancy_fifo_sample_fn(), you assign the value of 
ob-&gt;logfnid to 2 (the wshm variable is called logfnid), and off you go.  By
default, logfnid is zero, which points to the standard
write_data_fifo_sample_fn().
<p>

If you want to add a new logging function, you still need to add it to ulog.c,
and add a pointer to it to ob-&gt;log_fns[] in init_log_fns() (and run make).  But
once that's done, you can switch between existing logging functions by changing the logfnid index in shared memory.
<p>

Except for choosing the logger with logfnid instead of editing func.write_log,
the logging still works as below.

<h2>Kernel Side - old way</h2>
The InMotion2 main loop writes log file data by
calling a function pointed to by the pointer func.write_log.
This pointer is usually assigned in userfn.c:user_init(), for example:

<pre>
	func.write_log = write_data_fifo_sample_fn;
</pre>

<h2>Kernel Side - continue here</h2>

This is a typical example of a logging function, it logs a sampling counter,
x/y position, x/y velocity, and x/y motor forces:

<pre>
// write counter, then nlog doubles from log array, into dofifo.

void
write_data_fifo_sample_fn(void)
{
    s32 j;

    dpr(3, "write_log\n");
    if (ob-&gt;nlog &lt; 1)
        return;

    j = 0;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = (f64) ob-&gt;i;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;pos.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;pos.y;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;vel.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;vel.y;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;motor_force.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;motor_force.y;

    rtf_put(ob-&gt;dofifo, ob-&gt;log, (sizeof(ob-&gt;log[0]) * ob-&gt;nlog));
}
</pre>

The logging function performs several steps:
<ol>
<li>It checks whether the user wants data logged at all.
<li>If the user wants log data, the log function gathers the
data into the logging output buffer ob-&gt;log[ ].
<li>After the data is in the output buffer, it written to the
log data fifo, using rtf_put().
<li>This completes the job of the kernel-mode side of data logging.  Once
the data for a sample is written, another program on the user-mode
side must read the data from the fifo and copy it to a file.
</ol>
<p>
This logging function is called once per sample when the control loop is
running (not paused).  At the top of the function, there is a control variable
ob-&gt;nlog.  Setting nlog (usually from user-mode) turns logging on or off.  If
nlog is set to zero, the function returns immediately.  If nlog is greater than
zero, the logging function does its work.
The nlog variable has two jobs:  to tell
the kernel module whether to write log data at all, and if so, to tell it how
many data items to write per sample.
<p>
Note that the value stored in the nlog variable does not specify how many
samples (rows or lines) are written to the log file, it specifies how many data
items (columns) are written per sample.  Sampling is usually turned on and off
by a user-mode program.  If you need a precise number of samples (instead of
just asking the logger to start and stop when you press a button or trigger a
user-mode timer), you must write code to do that in your write_log()
function, keeping a logged-samples counter, and zeroing nlog when the desired
number is reached.

<p>

If nlog is greater than zero, the data items specified in the logging
function are copied to successive elements of the array, ob-&gt;log[ ],
starting with ob-&gt;log[0].  The idiom, ob-&gt;log[j++], is used to specify
the successive elements of the array, so that if you want to shuffle the
elements around, or insert new elements in the middle of the list,
the code will take care of the array indices.
<p>

In the example above, the seven data items are stored in the log
array, at indices 0 through 6.  Notice that the sample number i is an
integer.  All elements of log are double-precision floating point, so
i is converted to double when it is copies.  There is an explicit C
cast here (f64), it is a reminder to the reader, C would have
performed the cast automatically anyway.  These seven data items are each
eight bytes long, so 56 bytes are written per sample period.
<p>

The variable nlog is greater than zero, and data has been copied from system
state variables to the log buffer, log[ ].  Now log[ ] needs to be written to
an output stream from kernel space.  This is done by calling the rtf_put()
function in the last line.  rtf_put() works like a C write() system call.  This
is how its function parameters are defined:

<ol>
<li>
The first arg is a file descriptor, in this case dofifo.  dofifo
is opened by the InMotion2 kernel module
when it is loaded, and it is assigned to real-time fifo number
1, similar to UNIX standard output being assigned to file descriptor
1.  Real-time fifo number 1 can be read in user mode using the file named /dev/rtf1
<li>The second arg is the address of the data buffer to be written, in
this case the log buffer we have just prepared.
<li>The third arg is the length of the data in the buffer, in bytes.
We know that ob-&gt;log[] is an array of 64-bit doubles.  The user
specifies the number of log entries required by setting the value of
nlog.  sizeof(ob-&gt;log[0]) will be 8 bytes, because it's a double,
and this is multiplied by nlog.
</ol>
<p>

This function is set up to collect the sample number, position,
velocity, and motor forces, 7 data items in all.  Let's say that 
for this run the user only wants to see the sample number and x/y
position, because we just want to plot the manipulandum position
path over time, x vs y.  We can use the function show here, and if we
set nlog to 3 (probably by setting its value from user mode through
shared memory), the first three values will be sent out to the log data
output real time fifo.

<h2>User Side</h2>
<p>
The data has not been saved to a file yet, it has only
being sent to a fifo.
(It is getting sent through a pipe,
but we have no bucket at the end of of the pipe).
In this example, the fifo is called ob-&gt;dofifo
(data output fifo), which the kernel module has set up as real time fifo number 1.  The user-mode handle for this fifo is the file named /dev/rtf1
<p>

The data output fifo dofifo (/dev/rtf1), is opened whenever the
InMotion2 kernel module is loaded, but data only gets sent to the fifo when
nlog &gt; 0.  To read from the fifo, have a user-mode program
open /dev/rtf0 and start reading, when you set nlog greater than zero
in shared memory, data will start flowing out during each sample
period.  To stop logging, set nlog to zero, and stop
the program that is reading the log data.
<p>

This is done in Tcl programs using procs like the following:

<pre>
proc start_log {logfile {num 3} {uheaderfile ""}} {
    global ob

    # puts "start_log $logfile $num"
    wshm nlog $num

    # make sure the dir is there
    file mkdir [file dirname $logfile]

    # write log header
    logheader $logfile $num $uheaderfile

    set ob(savedatpid) [exec cat &lt; /dev/rtf1 &gt;&gt; $logfile &]
}

proc stop_log {} {
    global ob

    # puts "stop_log"
    wshm nlog 0
    if [info exists ob(savedatpid)] {
        exec kill $ob(savedatpid)
        unset ob(savedatpid)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>

The proc start_log sets nlog to the number of data items to save.
after that is done, it writes an informational logfile header.  (Older
versions of start_log did not write a header.)  After the header is
written, the final line of start_log executes the Linux "cat" program,
which connects ("catenates") the data output real-time fifo
(/dev/rtf1) to the logfile named in the start_log command.  The process ID
of the cat process is saved in ob(savedatpid).
<p>

When logging is done, nlog is set to zero in shared memory, and the
logging process (cat) is stopped by killing the process specified by the
process ID, ob(savedatpid).
<p>

In this case, we may have called start_log like this:
<pre>
	start_log /tmp/xy.dat 3
	# later...
	stop_log
</pre>

The data is now in /tmp/xy.dat, as a stream
64-bit double binary data.  This is raw data, but we know that we
asked for a 3 items per sample.
You can write a program to process the binary data, or you can convert
it to ASCII (plain text), using the ta.tcl (ta for To ASCII),
using the command
ta.tcl.  Newer versions of the logging software write the number of
columns in the log file, and ta.tcl reads it from there,
so it need not be specified on the ta.tcl command line.  Older versions
of ta.tcl (before August 2003) took the number-of-entries-per-sample as the
first arg, so you run:

<pre>
	ta.tcl 3 /tmp/xy.dat &gt; /tmp/xt.asc
</pre>

The conversion from binary to plain-text ASCII is not complicated, you can
write your own conversion script to suit your requirements.

<p>

From here, you can run your data through gnuplot or some other analysis
software.  This is a slice of a typical log data file converted to ASCII,
with ten samples of x/y data, each one preceded by a sample number:
