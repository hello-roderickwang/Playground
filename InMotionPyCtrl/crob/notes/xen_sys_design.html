<h1>InMotion2 Robot Software System Design Overview</h1>

Tue Feb  2 15:14:20 EST 2016

<h2>Scope</h2>

This document is an overview of the Interactive Motion Technologies
InMotion2 Robot Software System.  This document does not provide
detailed design information, but rather serves to introduce system
design concepts as orientation for InMotion2 robot researchers and
other users.  This document describes a two-degree-of-freedom arm
(shoulder/elbow) robot, but also applies to other robots in the IMT
family, including the IMT arm with hand, wrist, and ankle robots.
<p>
We describe the arm robot (without hand robot attached),
but the operating theory of our other robots is similar.

<h2>What does the arm robot hardware look like?</h2>

The InMotion2 arm robot hardware consists of these hardware components:
<ul>
<li> arm robot body - the mechanical part that moves
<li> electrical box with wired remote control - it contains a computer,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">
microcontroller,</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_drive">
servo-amplifiers</a>
and power systems.
<li> display and keyboard
<li> cabling
<li> workstation - the robot is attached to this
</ul>

The arm robot has two degrees of freedom
that permit the handle to travel freely in the horizontal plane
This allows shoulder and elbow motion
with the weight of the patient's arm supported by a moving cradle.

The arm robot has two links that are attached to the motors in a parallelogram shape, as with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph">
pantograph.</a>
This configuration of robot is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA">
SCARA</a>
(Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm).
<p>

Other IMT robots are designed for a specific body parts.
<ul>
<li> The hand robot has one degree of freedom that allow open/close hand motin.
<li> The wrist robot has three degrees of freedom that allow wrist motion in flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and pronation/supination axes.
<li> The ankle robot has two degrees of freedom that allow motion in the dorsiflextion/plantarflexion and inversion/eversion axes.
</ul>
<p>

Each degree of freedom for the robot contains a motor with a position sensor, 
controlled by a servo-amplifier.
A robot with two degrees of freedom will have two of each of these.

<h2>What does the software do?</h2>

The InMotion2 arm robot has two back-drivable motors and encoders for
sensing x/y position.
Back-drivable means that a person can move the motors,
instead of only the motors being able to move themselves.
Back-drivability is important for patient comfort and safety.
<p>
Forces at the handle are determined by measuring the forces
imposed by the motors on the patient.
The InMotion2 software system controls the robot hardware by
reading data from, and writing data to, these devices, and by allowing
robot programmers to design the control systems to suit their needs.
<p>

These robot components are controlled by reading and writing data
over a serial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">
CAN bus</a>
to servo-amplifier drives
that control the robot motors.

<h2>Operating System Structure</h2>

The InMotion2 software system runs on an
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">
Ubuntu</a>
operating system distribution running a
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">
Linux</a>
operating system kernel, augmented with a
<a href="http://www.xenomai.org/">
Xenomai</a>
real-time framework.
Xenomai provides Linux with low-latency for interrupts and
other real-time requirements by running the Linux kernel as a
subordinate task under a tiny microkernel.
<p>

<h2>Control Loop</h2>

The InMotion2 robot control loop performs these tasks during each
sample period (usually 200 samples per second):

<ul>
<li> read data from robot sensors
<li> calculate controls based on input data
<li> write control data to robot motors
<li> write data to log channels
</ul>

Other minor housekeeping tasks include time measurement, error
checking, and so on.

<h2>User Mode I/O and GUI</h2>

Programs that interact with a graphic display monitor
are separate from the control loop code.
These Linux programs communicate with the control loop
using either real-time pipes
which look like Linux named pipes,
or using usermode shared memory buffers,
which allow user mode C programs to share
one or more memory regions.

<h2>What language do we use?</h2>

The InMotion2 control loop module is written in C, the language of the
Linux kernel.  We do not write in C++, because C++ has dynamic aspects,
such as constructor/destructor and exception handling that
sometimes have unbounded behaviors, and if their use were allowed, they
could complicate the deterministic requirements of real-time systems.
Linus Torvalds, author of Linux, has
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/e96fbe3dd8f3f937">
posted his views on the subject of using C++ in the Linux kernel,</a>
which has some relevance to our decision to use C.
<p>

The user-mode programs (like GUIs programs that save log data) may be
written in C too, or they may be written in C++ or in whatever language
runs on the Linux system.  We prefer
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">
Tcl/Tk</a>, for its power and GUI capabilities.
You may wish to code your GUI in Python or Perl, or another language.
Traditional UNIX tools like sh and cat may be used, for example, to
read reference data and write log data files.

<h2>Passing Data between User and Kernel Modes</h2>

Occasional data, like a request to tell the
control loop to start or stop sampling, is sent using shared memory
buffers (shm).

File-oriented per-sample data like logs are sent over
real-time pipes (rtpipes).

Per sample data that isn't being filed, like x/y
position of the handle, used by a GUI, may be passed through
either interface.  Both shm and rtpipes have access to all data,
you can use whichever seems more appropriate.
<p>

<h3>Shared Memory</h3>
To access shared memory from a user interface, the InMotion2 system provides a
C program called "shm" (shared memory) that allows text-mode access to
set and get variable data in the running system, so you can do it
without writing your own low-level shared memory access code.  The shm
program is also used to provide the system with initial device
calibration and stiffness and damping control values.  When the
InMotion2 robot module is loaded, you can run shm from the shell command
line and use it to read and modify InMotion2 robot data.
If you want to write your own shm access code, you may use the
source code to shm as an example.  <p>

<h3>Real Time Pipes</h3>
User mode access to rtpipes is simple.  If the control loop is writing a
stream of log data, you may capture it from user-mode with a simple file
read system call, or by using a program like Linux "cat."
