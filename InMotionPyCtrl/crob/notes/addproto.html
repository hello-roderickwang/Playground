<h1>Adding a new game protocol</h1>

The robot game protocols are stored in a directory tree with
files that contain variables specifying variable elements
of the different games.  Such variables might indicate whether
a game sends forces, whether a log file is stored, how long before each
slot times out, and so forth.
<p>
Note that in the current IMT Games implementation, this protocol structure
is only for the clock game.  The protocol structure can be applied to
other games.  The other games don't have the variety of protocols
that require this structure, but the protocol has provisions to accommodate
other games in the data structure if required.
<p>

<h2>PROTOCOLS_HOME</h2>

The default set of robot protocols is stored in
<tt>/opt/imt/robots/protocols,</tt> and this directory name
is the default value of the <tt>PROTOCOLS_HOME</tt>
environment variable.  If you want to add your own
protocols, you need to copy the whole <tt>protocols</tt> directory
tree into your own directory, and change the value of
<tt>PROTOCOLS_HOME</tt> in <tt>imt.rc</tt> to point to it.
(When you change <tt>imt.rc,</tt> you need to log out and
back in, for the change to take effect.)

<h2>Protocols Directory Structure</h2>

The protocols directory has the following structure:
<tt>protocols</tt>/<i>robot/game/protocol</i>
where <tt>protocols</tt> is the name of the base of the directory, and
<i>robot/game/protocol</i> are three variable directory name elements.
<p>

For example, the adaptive clock game for the planar robot is in the directory:
<p>

<tt>protocols/planar/clock/adaptive</tt>
<p>
The adaptivegrasp clock game for the planarhand robot is in the directory:
<p>
<tt>protocols/planarhand/clock/adaptivegrasp</tt>
<p>
If you want to add a bounce protocol to the wrist robot, you would put it in:
<p>
<tt>protocols/wrist/clock/bounce</tt>

<h2>Inside a Protocol Directory</h2>

A typical protocol is the planar robot clock adaptive
protocol.  It lives in the directory
<tt>protocols/planar/clock/adaptive</tt> .
This directory contains the following files:
<p>
<tt>base/  eval/ therapy/  eval_list  therapy_list</tt>
<p>

These files specify the details of the protocol,
and the files must be present, with these names.
The base directory contains basic description files of the game types,
which are inherited by other games.  The eval and therapy directories
have files that describe individual instances of the games.

<p>
<h3>Protocol List Files</h3>
The files <tt>eval_list</tt> and <tt>therapy_list</tt> are text files that
contain a Tcl list with pairs of elements on each line: the first is the file name in this protocol direcory, and the second name is the string that is shown in the games console screen.  For example:

<pre>
set ob(therapylist) {
therapy/oneway_rec_1 "One Way Record 1"
therapy/adaptive_1 "Adaptive 1"
}
</pre>

This will put two games in the Therapy List in the clock
games console.  The first will be called "One Way Record 1"
in the list, and the protocol description file will be
<tt>protocols/planar/clock/adaptive/therapy/oneway_rec_1</tt>
.
<p>
In these list files, be careful to notice the position of
the "quotes" and {curly braces} and make sure you keep them
properly paired and matched, so that the Tcl program can parse
them properly.
<p>


<h3>Protocol Variable Directories</h3>
The other three files, <tt>base,</tt> <tt>eval,</tt> and
<tt>therapy,</tt> are directories containing files with the
variable settings that distinguish each game in a protocol.
The files have in "inheritance structure" that lets you
say that a new game is almost like an old game, but it might
have one variable changed.  These files are written with Tcl
commands, and only two commands are usually used.  One is
the <tt>source</tt> command, which includes another file (to inherit
the variables it sets).  The other command is a shorthand
command called <tt>s</tt> (for set) that is used to set
variables.

For example, the file <tt>/protocols/planar/clock/adaptive/therapy/oneway_rec_1</tt> looks like this:

<pre>
source ../base/base_oneway
s namestr "One Way Record 1"
s log yes
s logperslot yes
</pre>

It gets most of its settings from
<tt>../base/base_oneway</tt> and sets some other variables
with the <tt>s</tt> command.

<h3>Inheritance Chain</h3>

If you look at the inheritance chain for oneway_rec_2 in the
planar adaptive protocol,

<p>
<tt>therapy/oneway_rec_2</tt> inherits from<br>
<tt>therapy/oneway_rec_1</tt> inherits from<br>
<tt>base/base_oneway</tt> inherits from<br>
<tt>base/base_default</tt> .

<h2>Adding a New Protocol to the Game Configuration</h2>
After you have placed a new protocol in the PROTOCOLS_HOME
directory structure, there is a separate database that you
need to modify to tell the clock games console to show the
protocol as available to use.
<p>
The file that stores that data is
<tt>$IMT_CONFIG/robots</tt>/<i>robot</i>/<tt>robot.cfg</tt> - for example,
<tt>imt_config/robots/planar/robot.cfg.</tt>

Its contents might look like this (the end is shortened):
<pre>
# this cfg file is usually written by the lgames/config program.
# you may edit it yourself to add items to the
# games,list or proto,list entries
# Mon Jan 19 04:04:39 PM EST 2009

array set cfg {
planar,clock,proto,list {adaptive playback brh05a brh05b}
planar,clock,proto,sellist {adaptive playback}
planar,cs,proto,list default
planar,cs,proto,sellist default
...
}
</pre>

<p>

Look at the first two lines that start with
<tt>planar,clock</tt> .  The first is the <tt>list</tt>. the
second is the <tt>selllist</tt>.  The list is all the
protocols that are available to be selected, and the sellist
is the ones that are actually selected.  The protocols that are selected
are the ones that are displayed in your game Protocols menu, like the one
in the clock Games Console.
<p>
The name of the protocol in these lists (inside the {curly braces}) is the
name of the protocols above in the <i>robot/game/protocol</i> name structure (for example, <tt>planar/clock/adaptive</tt>).
<p>

Note that in the example above, some of the lists are called
"default" without surrounding curly braces.  This is a Tcl
detail, a one element list (like default) doesn't require
braces around it.
<p>

<h2>Choosing a Protocol From Those Available</h2>
Once you add the new protocol to the robot.cfg file, you
need a way to "turn the protocols on and off."  There are
two levels to this.
<ol>
<li>Choose which protocols are
available to the particular game (like clock)
<li>Choose which one of the available protocols you are using
for a particular patient.
</ol>
<p>

For example, you have three protocols for planar clock,
called <tt>adaptive,</tt> <tt>playback,</tt> and
<tt>random.</tt>  You want to make only the
<tt>adaptive</tt> and <tt>playback</tt> choices available, and then
you want to choose <tt>adaptive.</tt>
<p>
Perform these steps:
<ol>
<li>Edit the <tt>robot.cfg</tt> file put all three protocols in the sellist.
<li>Run the configuration program <tt>$LGAMES_HOME/config/config.tcl</tt>, specifying only <tt>adaptive</tt> and <tt>playback.</tt>
<li>Then run the clock Games Console and click the Protocols item in the menu, and choose <tt>adaptive</tt> from the two in the list (that comes from the <tt>robot.cfg</tt> sellist).
</ol>

The purpose of the config.tcl program is to change
the <tt>sellist</tt> based on the <tt>list.</tt>  We assume that you
will add new protocols infrequently (which is done in a text editor) but you
will set up the list of possible choices more frequently, which you do with
<tt>config.tcl</tt> .

<h2>Summary</h2>
To add a new protocol, you have to decide what goes into it,
establish its place in the <tt>protocols</tt> directory
structure, edit the <tt>robot.cfg</tt> file so that the games console can
find it, and then choose the protocol from among those available in the
console.
