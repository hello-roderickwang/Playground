<h2>Writing Log Data</h2>
Thu Sep 21 18:26:29 EDT 2006
<p>
This document describes the process of writing data to a logfile using
the InMotion2 system.  The first part explains how to use logging
functions that already exist.  The second part explains how to write and call
your own logging functions.
<p>

Note: In the older RTLinux system, the data stream capability was called a
real-time fifo.  In the newer Xenomai system, the similar capability is called
a real-time pipe.  The code and documentation sometimes refers to fifos.
Think of these as being identical to pipes.
<p>

<h2>Using existing scripts to manage log files</h2>
<h3>dolog</h3>
The dolog script will attach to a robot program that is
already running and open a logfile for it.
dolog is a script that calls the start_log and stop_log Tcl 
procs described below.
<p>
dolog takes as its arguments a base name for the generated
logfile, a lug function id, and a number of columns to log.
<p>
In a terminal widow, run the program:
<p>
$ $CROB_HOME/tools/dolog run1 0 9
<p>
It will print something like:
<p>
<pre>
writing log file /home/imt/imt_logs/20060921_Thu/run1.170933.dat
logger 0, 9 items.
press enter to start logging.
</pre>
<p>
When you press enter here, it will print
<p>
<pre>
writing to logfnid 9
press enter to stop logging.
</pre>
<p>

and then it will start writing data to the logfile shown.
It gets the head of the directory/filename
from the LOG_HOME shell variable,
which is /home/imt/imt_logs by default.  The rest of the directory/filename
structure is based on the date and time of day, and the base filename (run1)
that you typed.  When you hit enter again, it will close the log file and exit.
<h3>gplot</h3>
After you have written this log file, there is a script that calls the
Linux program gnuplot.  Gnuplot is feature-rich and somewhat complicated,
so gplot lets you call it in a simple way, to get simple plots.
<p>
The typical planar logfile has the following columns:
<ol type=1>
<li>count
<li>x position
<li>y position
<li>x velocity
<li>y velocity
<li>...
</ol>
To plot x position vs y position, you'd run:
<pre>
$ $CROB_HOME/tools/gplot $LOG_HOME/20060921_Thu/run1.170933.dat 2 3
</pre>

To plot time vs x position and time vs y position on one plot:
<pre>
$ $CROB_HOME/tools/gplot $LOG_HOME/20060921_Thu/run1.170933.dat 1 2 1 3
</pre>

gplot will let you display up to four pairs on the same plot.
If you want more control over plots, use the gnuplot command in its full glory.

<h3>ta.tcl</h3>
The ta.tcl script is in the $CROB_HOME directory (not $CROB_HOME/tools).
You can run it to convert a binary data file to a plain text ASCII
data file, to prepare it for further processing.  Data columns are
separated by spaces.  Columns contain different data items, 
rows contain successive samples.  The ta in ta.tcl stands for "to ASCII".

<p>

This command will convert the binary data file shown to ASCII.
<pre>
$ $CROB_HOME/ta.tcl $LOG_HOME/20060921_Thu/run1.170933.dat &gt; /tmp/run1.asc 
</pre>

A plain text file like this can be read by programs like Matlab or Excel.

<p>
<b>The rest of this note describes Tcl and C code for generating log file data.</b>
<h2>Control Loop Side</h2>

The robot system has different log functions for different tasks.  If you
are running a planar robot, you want a log of planar data, a wrist robot
will get wrist data.  Different experiments might require different
data items to be logged once per sample.
<p>
The robot software system provides an
array of pointers to logging functions
(similar to the array of slot functions), and you can choose a logging
function by selecting the index into the ob-&gt;log_fns[] array.
<p>
Logging functions for the planar robot are stored in pl_ulog.c .  For
the wrist robot, they are stored in wr_ulog.c .

<p>
Pointers to these logging functions are kept in the array log_fns[],
which is initialized in the function init_log_fns(), which is stored in
pl_ulog.c, even for the non-planar robots - it's a single collection of
log function pointers for all the robots.
<p>

Let's say that pl_ulog.c has these log_fns defined:

<pre>
void
init_log_fns(void)
{
	ob-&gt;log_fns[0] =  write_data_fifo_sample_fn;
	ob-&gt;log_fns[1] =  write_motor_test_fifo_sample_fn;
	ob-&gt;log_fns[2] =  write_fancy_fifo_sample_fn;
	...
}
</pre>
If you want to use write_fancy_fifo_sample_fn(), you assign the value of 
ob-&gt;logfnid to 2 (the wshm variable is called logfnid), and off you go.  By
default, logfnid is zero, which points to the standard
write_data_fifo_sample_fn().
<p>

If you want to add a new logging function, you still need to add it to ulog.c,
and add a pointer to it to ob-&gt;log_fns[] in init_log_fns() (and run make).  But
once that's done, you can switch between existing logging functions by changing the logfnid index in shared memory.
<p>

Except for choosing the logger with logfnid instead of editing func.write_log,
the logging still works as below.

<h3>Logging function</h3>
This is a typical example of a logging function, it logs a sampling counter,
x/y position, x/y velocity, x/y/z force transducer forces, and grasp sensor
force.

<pre>
// write counter, then nlog doubles from log array, into dofifo.

void
write_data_fifo_sample_fn(void)
{
    s32 j;

    dpr(3, "write_log\n");
    if (ob-&gt;nlog &lt; 1)
        return;

    j = 0;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = (f64) ob-&gt;i;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;pos.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;pos.y;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;vel.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;vel.y;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;ft.world.x;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;ft.world.y;
    ob-&gt;log[j++] = ob-&gt;ft.world.z;

    ob-&gt;log[j++] = rob-&gt;grasp.force;

    rt_pipe_write(&amp;(ob-&gt;dofifo), ob-&gt;log, (sizeof(ob-&gt;log[0]) * ob-&gt;nlog), P_NORMAL);
}
</pre>

The logging function performs several steps:
<ol>
<li>It checks whether the user wants data logged at all.
<li>If the user wants log data, the log function gathers the
data into the logging output buffer ob-&gt;log[ ].
<li>After the data is in the output buffer, it written to the
log data pipe, using rt_pipe_write().
<li>This completes the job of the kernel-mode side of data logging.  Once
the data for a sample is written, another program on the user-mode
side must read the data from the pipe and copy it to a file.
</ol>
<p>
This logging function is called once per sample when the control loop is
running (not paused).  At the top of the function, there is a control variable
ob-&gt;nlog.  Setting nlog (usually from user-mode) turns logging on or off.  If
nlog is set to zero, the function returns immediately.  If nlog is greater than
zero, the logging function does its work.
The nlog variable has two jobs:  to tell
the kernel module whether to write log data at all, and if so, to tell it how
many data items to write per sample.
<p>
Note that the value stored in the nlog variable does not specify how many
samples (rows or lines) are written to the log file, it specifies how many data
items (columns) are written per sample.  Sampling is usually turned on and off
by a user-mode program.  If you need a precise number of samples (instead of
just asking the logger to start and stop when you press a button or trigger a
user-mode timer), you must write code to do that in your write_log()
function, keeping a logged-samples counter, and zeroing nlog when the desired
number is reached.

<p>

If nlog is greater than zero, the data items specified in the logging
function are copied to successive elements of the array, ob-&gt;log[ ],
starting with ob-&gt;log[0].  The idiom, ob-&gt;log[j++], is used to specify
the successive elements of the array, so that if you want to shuffle the
elements around, or insert new elements in the middle of the list,
the code will take care of the array indices.
<p>

In the example above, the seven data items are stored in the log
array, at indices 0 through 6.  Notice that the sample number i is an
integer.  All elements of log are double-precision floating point, so
i is converted to double when it is copies.  There is an explicit C
cast here (f64), it is a reminder to the reader, C would have
performed the cast automatically anyway.  These seven data items are each
eight bytes long, so 56 bytes are written per sample period.
<p>

The variable nlog is greater than zero, and data has been copied from system
state variables to the log buffer, log[ ].  Now log[ ] needs to be written to
an output stream from kernel space.  This is done by calling the rt_pipe_write()
function in the last line.  rt_pipe_write() works like a C write() system call.  This
is how its function parameters are defined:

<ol>
<li>
The first arg is the address of a file descriptor, in this case dofifo.  dofifo
is opened by the InMotion2 control loop
when it is loaded, and it is assigned to real-time pipe number
1, similar to UNIX standard output being assigned to file descriptor
1.  Real-time pipe number 1 can be read in user mode using the file named /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out
<li>The second arg is the address of the data buffer to be written, in
this case the log buffer we have just prepared.
<li>The third arg is the length of the data in the buffer, in bytes.
We know that ob-&gt;log[] is an array of 64-bit doubles.  The user
specifies the number of log entries required by setting the value of
nlog.  sizeof(ob-&gt;log[0]) will be 8 bytes, because it's a double,
and this is multiplied by nlog.
<li>The fourth arg is the flag P_NORMAL, which causes new data to be appended to the pipe.  P_URGENT would cause data to be prepended to the pipe.
</ol>
<p>

This function is set up to collect the sample number, position,
velocity, force transducer forces, and grasp force, 9 data items in all.  Let's say that 
for this run the user only wants to see the sample number and x/y
position, because we just want to plot the manipulandum position
path over time, x vs y.  We can use the function show here, and if we
set nlog to 3 (probably by setting its value from user mode through
shared memory), the first three values will be sent out to the log data
output real time pipe.

<h2>User Side</h2>
<p>
The data has not been saved to a file yet, it has only
being sent to a pipe.
(It is getting sent through a pipe,
but we have no bucket at the end of of the pipe).
In this example, the pipe is called ob-&gt;dofifo
(data output pipe), which the kernel module has set up as real time pipe number 1.  The user-mode handle for this pipe is the file named /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out
<p>

The data output pipe dofifo (/proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out), is opened whenever the
InMotion2 kernel module is loaded, but data only gets sent to the pipe when
nlog &gt; 0.  To read from the pipe, have a user-mode program
open /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out and start reading, when you set nlog greater than zero
in shared memory, data will start flowing out during each sample
period.  To stop logging, set nlog to zero, and stop
the program that is reading the log data.
<p>

This is done in Tcl programs using procs like the following:

<pre>
proc start_log {logfile {num 3} {uheaderfile ""}} {
    global ob

    # puts "start_log $logfile $num"
    wshm nlog $num

    # make sure the dir is there
    file mkdir [file dirname $logfile]

    # write log header
    logheader $logfile $num $uheaderfile

    set ob(savedatpid) [exec cat &lt; /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out &gt;&gt; $log
}

proc stop_log {} {
    global ob

    # puts "stop_log"
    wshm nlog 0
    if [info exists ob(savedatpid)] {
        exec kill $ob(savedatpid)
        unset ob(savedatpid)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>

The proc start_log sets nlog to the number of data items to save.
after that is done, it writes an informational logfile header.  (Older
versions of start_log did not write a header.)  After the header is
written, the final line of start_log executes the Linux "cat" program,
which connects ("catenates") the data output real-time pipe
(/proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/crob_out) to the logfile named in the start_log command.  The process ID
of the cat process is saved in ob(savedatpid).
<p>

When logging is done, nlog is set to zero in shared memory, and the
logging process (cat) is stopped by killing the process specified by the
process ID, ob(savedatpid).
<p>

In this case, we may have called start_log like this:
<pre>
	start_log /tmp/xy.dat 3
	# later...
	stop_log
</pre>

The data is now in /tmp/xy.dat, as a stream
64-bit double binary data.  This is raw data, but we know that we
asked for a 3 items per sample.
You can write a program to process the binary data, or you can convert
it to ASCII (plain text),
using the command ta.tcl:

<pre>
	$ ta.tcl /tmp/xy.dat &gt; /tmp/xt.asc
</pre>

The conversion from binary to plain-text ASCII is not complicated, you can
write your own conversion script to suit your requirements, for instance,
if you need to convert the data on another kind of computer.

<p>

From here, you can run your data through gnuplot or some other analysis
software.  This is a slice of a typical log data file converted to ASCII,
with ten samples of x/y position data, each one preceded by a sample number:
