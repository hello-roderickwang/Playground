Mouse setup

Mon Jun 30 18:47:45 EDT 2003

Earlier InMotion2 PCs were delivered with standard 3-button PS2 mice.

Newer InMotion2 PCs are delivered with Keytronic 2MOUSEPS2-451BL PS2
mice with two normal outside buttons, plus a scroll-wheel/mouse-button
combo for the middle button.

Linux X Window System sets up mouse support with the mouseconfig tool:

	/usr/sbin/mouseconfig

The standard 3-button mouse is configured as:

	Generic 3 Button Mouse (PS/2)

The Keytronic 2MOUSEPS2-451BL2 mouse is configured as:

	Microsoft IntelliMouse (PS/2)

you must run mouseconfig as root, and you must restart X for the
settings to take effect.

After configuration, middle-button pasting should work, and the
scroll-wheel (if present) should be supported by Mozilla,
gnome-terminal, and other programs that support it.
