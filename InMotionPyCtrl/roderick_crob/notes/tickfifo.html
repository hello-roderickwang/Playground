<h2>Tick Fifo</h2>

<p>

The InMotion2 Linux Kernel Module's (LKM) robot control loop "clock"
ticks very precisely because it is built on the RTLinux real-time
system.  In user mode programs, it is sometimes necessary to perform
periodic tasks, like screen updates or I/O to other devices, and it is
useful to have access to a timer that ticks precisely.

<p>
We can use the fact that the robot control loop writes data to its
fifos during every sample, to provide the precise control loop timer
capability to user mode processes.

<p>
There is an InMotion2 LKM fifo called the "tick fifo" that you can
turn on and off with a shm variable called "ntickfifo" (n tick fifo).
When ntickfifo is set non-zero, the robot module will write a single
newline to the tick fifo (/dev/rtf5) once per sample (usually 200
times per second).  You can set up a loop to read single characters
(or line buffered reads, since it's a newline) from this fifo with a
blocking read, and it will read exactly once per sample.

<p>
Or better, in C, you can set up a "select" system call to check for
input on this fifo in an event-driven loop, and it will wake up once
per sample with very precise timing.  (This is even easier to do in
Tcl, using "fileevent".)

<p>
When you use ntickfifo, you should be careful to start reading it right
after you set ntickfifo to non-zero, and to make sure you clear the
fifo after you set ntickfifo to zero, to make sure that "junk newlines"
in the tick fifo don't confuse your timings.
