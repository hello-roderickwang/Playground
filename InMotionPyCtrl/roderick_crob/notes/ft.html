ATI Force Transducer</a>
(FT)
may be mounted to detect forces at the end of the robot arm.
This note describes the configuration of this FT.

<h2>FT device </h2>
The FT device looks like a hockey puck.  
It is marked along its circumference with +X, +Y, -X, and -Y.
With the FT is mounted with on the manipulandum (handle)
at the tip of the robot arm, when you pull the
handle toward the +X marking, the FT returns a force vector
pointing toward +X.
<p>
The FT is a delicate device that can measure very small changes in
force and torque.  It is attached to its mounting post by four screws.
There is a shim between the mounting post plate and the FT, be sure it
remains there when you reassemble the handle.  The four mounting
screws are tightened a bit past finger-tight.  If these screws are too
tight, the FT may become damaged, or it may register downward force
from the force of the screws.

<h2>FT Data</h2>
The FT returns a matrix of six data items during each sample iteration.  This
data is passed through a set of matrix transforms, and this process returns an
array of six items: force X, Y, Z vectors, and torque X, Y, Z moments.
The InMotion2 system returns FT moment data values in device space, but moment
data is not used elsewhere in the robot system.

<p>
These matrices are provided by the FT manufacturer on a CD uniquely matched
by serial number
with each FT.
IMT provides this data in imt2.cal as ft_cal (a 6x6 matrix, 36 values)
and ft_scale (6 values).

<p>
In addition to these calibration parameters, the FT must be biased to account
for the weight of the manipulandum, mounting hardware, and of the FT itself,
and whether it is mounted right-side up or upside down.  You can run the
<b>getftbias</b> program to get ft_bias numbers for the calibration file imt2.cal, or
you can get FT bias values while your program is running using the Tcl ft_bias
procedure or something similar.

<h2>FT Hardware Interface Driver Board</h2>
Earlier versions of the InMotion2 controlled the ATI FT with an ISA
interface board in the PC system.  These FT's are called ISA FT's.
<p>
More recent models (built after
2001) drive the FT with the same UEI data acquisition board that handles
the rest of the analog and digital data in the InMotion2 system.
<p>
The ISA FT's and the newer FT's are functionally equivalent from the
user software perspective, but the InMotion2 control software (RTLinux
or its predecessor), handle the devices differently at the hardware
level.  To tell the RTLinux robot software how to distinguish between
the two, if you have an ISA FT, you set the <b>have_isaft</b> flag to
1 in imt2.cal .  If you have either an old ISA or
new UEI-driven FT, you set <b>have_ft</b> to 1 in both cases.
<p>

<h2>Device Orientation</h2>
In the default InMotion2 system configuration,
the FT is attached above the "wrist" of the robot arm,
with the manipulandum attached above FT.
Oddly, in this "right-side" up case, the printing on the FT is
upside-down.  When mounted this way, when you push down on the
top of the manipulandum, the FT registers a -Z force vector.
<p>

It is also possible to mount the manipulandum below the arm,
that is, the FT is attached below the "wrist" of the robot arm,
with the manipulandum attached below the FT.
It is necessary to invert the FT in this configuration,
this case is called FT flipped.  If your FT is flipped, you must set
<b>ft_flip</b> to 1 in imt2.cal.
<p>

The FT device reports force vectors with respect to itself.  If you
are pushing on its top, it thinks you are pushing "down" (-Z), it
doesn't matter which direction down is in world space.  The InMotion2
system collects this "device-space" data, but it also translates this
data to "world space" (with respect to the workstation tabletop).
World space FT data depends on the device space FT data, and also on
the position of the tip of the manipulandum (which depends on link
lengths and encoder angles), and also on the offset angle that the FT
is screwed into its housing, and also whether the FT is flipped.
<p>

The FT offset angle in radians is set in imt2.cal by a variable called
<b>ft_offset</b>.  When you
mount the FT on the tip of the robot arm so that +X on the FT is pointing
in the same direction as the forearm (away from the elbow), that is an
ft_offset of 0.0 radians.
<p>

To mount the FT and manipulandum on the arm, there is a circular
mounting plate with four hex screws set at corners of a square.  This
square configuration allows the FT to be rotated at four 90 degree
angles and still align with the mounting plate.  There are two
orientation grooves on the handle mounting post that the FT and
manipulandum slide on to.  The two grooves are offset from each other
by 135 degrees (3/4 pi radians).  The intention is that you use the
alignment of these grooves and the four mounting plate set screws to
point +X in the same direction as the robot's forearm.  If you need
the FT placed in another orientation, you must set the ft_offset
calibration value to the angular offset in radians.
The FT is aligned to the mounting post groove
with a recessed set-screw, and tightened to the mounting post with
hand-tightened screw and a snap-ring.
<p>

To perform and verify this calibration procedure, run the <b>vex</b>
program and first verify that the FT device space values are reporting
correctly.  Once this is done, make sure that ft_offset
and ft_flip are correct.  As is noted above, world space forces depend
on calibrated encoder values, so the calibrate the encoder angles 
before the FT offset calibration is done.
