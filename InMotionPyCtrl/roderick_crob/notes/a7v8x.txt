We're using the ASUS A7V8X motherboard (based on the VIA KT400 chipset)
with an AMD Duron 1.6 (1533 MHz) CPU:

If you run /sbin/lspci , Linux identifies the Ethernet Controller as a
Broadcom (unknown type 4401).

RedHat 7.3 (6/2002) does not support the ethernet chip on this board
right out of the box.  You can download the Linux driver for it here:

(choose Linux to sift choices)

This web thread was quite helpful:

    http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/33441
    (copy in: bcm4400thread.html )

I downloaded:

    http://www.asus.com.tw/support/download/selectftp.aspx?l1_id=1&l2_id=15&l3_id=17&m_id=1&f_name=4401_653.zip

Note, this mobo comes with an optional Broadcom Gigabit Lan, I guess
that would be the 5700:

These are windows pkzip files, unpack them with pkzip25:
    http://linux.tucows.com/system/preview/8560.html
(or something compatible.)

To extract:
    $ pkzip -extract -directories 4401_653.zip  

The Linux driver is Linux/bcm4400-1.0.1.tar.gz.
See Linux/RELEASE.TXT for further install info.

Basically, I unpacked the tar.gz, compiled bcm4400.o with make, stuck it
in /lib/modules/nnn/kernel/drivers/net, added a line to /etc/modules.conf:

	alias eth0 bcm4400

Then I ran the /usr/bin/neat NEtwork Admin Tool, to set it up, reloaded
the network with "/sbin/service netowrk restart" (or did neat do that
automatically?) and I was good to go.
