<p>

Read this document completely before setting up the robot.
<p>

When powering up the robot for the first time, or after hardware
reconfiguration, follow these steps.
<p>
<ol>
<h2>Turning on the Robot hardware</h2>
<li>Make sure the panel door is closed.
<li>Be aware of the location of the Stop buttons on the panel
and/or on the cables.
<li><b>Turn on the red power switch</b> (in the upper right corner of the panel)
and check for strange sounds, smoke, and
so forth.
<li>If something seems wrong, press the Stop button immediately.
This applies brakes to the motors, and lights the red Reset lamp.
 It does not power off the panel.
<li>If the problem seems severe enough that you want to cut
power, turn off the red power switch.
<li>If the robot is not running as expected, call IMT.  After calling
IMT, you may be able to diagnose your problem by looking at the
documentation on the
<a href="panel.html">
control panel.</a>
<li>In the normal case, the robot will power up with no trouble.
You must <b>register the encoders</b> by moving both the shoulder and elbow
links.  You may do this with a small movement of the manipulandum
(the handle at the tip of the robot arm).
As each of the two links registers, you will hear a quiet click.
The two clicks may be close to simultaneous, so they may sound like one click.
<p>
<h2>Running the vex software</h2>
<li>
You are now ready to check the basic functioning of the robot.  Before
performing this check, always press the Stop button to light
the red Reset lamp and apply the brakes.
<p>

<p>
This procedure assumes the following:
<ul>
<li>you are logged into the InMotion2 RTLinux PC
<li>the X Window System is running
<li>you are running with root permissions in a terminal window
<li>you are in the directory /home/imt/crob/
</ul>

<p>
The InMotion2 software components should be in place.
 If they are not, this procedure will fail and software
will print diagnostic warning messages.
<p>
Most problems with setting up the robot arm can be fixed by adjusting
configuration parameters in the calibration file, <b>imt2.cal</b> .

<p>
<li><b>Run the vex program</b> ( # ./vex ) to display system vectors,
such as position, velocity, force transducer, and motor forces.
The vex program will open two
windows, a text window titled top, and a graphical window titled
vex.  Until the InMotion2 Linux Kernel Module is loaded and running,
there will be no active data in either of these windows.
Numeric text values and graphical vector values are color-coordinated
between these two windows.
<li><b>Click the green load button</b>. 
After a second or two,
<ul>
<li>the InMotion2 Linux Kernel Module will load
<li>the load button turn into a red unload button
<li>the run button will become activated and will turn from red to green.
</ul>
If you want to unload the InMotion2 Linux Kernel Module, click the
red unload button.
<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>
This document says "press" for buttons on the hardware control panel,
and "click" for buttons on the PC display.
<li>
The vex program buttons all turn gray when you mouse over them,
the button colors described here are when the mouse cursor is not
positioned over them.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Click the green run button.</b>
This starts the InMotion2 RTLinux control loop running.
<ul>
<li>the run button will turn into a red pause button.
<li>the text window (titled top) will display
system values in numeric text form.
<li>the other window (titled vex) will
display vectors and other graphical information.
</ul>
If you want to stop the robot control loop, click the red pause button.
<h2>Check the encoders</h2>
<li>
The encoders track the position of the shoulder and elbow links to
provide the X/Y position of the manipulandum.  The encoders are
located in the motor housings.
A yellow dot at the end of a gray line tracks the
encoder X/Y position on the graphical vex display.  X and Y positions (x, y)
are shown in millimeters on the text display (the Linux Kernel Module
reports them in meters, but the vex program multiplies them by 1000).

<li>
Check to assure that the yellow dot is centered on the vex display
when the manipulandum is centered correctly (usually in the middle of
the workstation table, 0.65 meters from the center of the motors).  If
the yellow dot is off the display, you will usually see a gray line
pointing to it.  If you move the manipulandum, and the gray line
moves, that means that either your encoders angles are not calibrated
or perhaps one or both of the encoder channels may be faulty or
misconfigured.  The encoder angles are called shoulder_angle_offset
and elbow_angle_offset , and are expressed in radians.  They are
measured individually, with each link immobilized and pointing
in the +X direction with respect to the motor housing.
<li>
Check that the yellow dot moves left, right, up, and down,
corresponding to movements of the manipulandum.  If the yellow dot
centers properly, X/Y motion is usually working too.  If X/Y motion is
not working, it's usually a problem with calibration or configuration
as above.

<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>On the vex display, left is -X, right is +X, up is +Y and down is -Y.
<li>On the workstation tabletop, left is -X, right is +X, toward the robot is +Y and toward the chair is -Y.
<li>When programming display software, -Y is usually up the screen and
+Y is down, so the software programmer must negate Y
in to get manipulandum motion to correspond to expected screen motion.
<li>+X/+Y usually goes down a screen (before negation) and to the right because
lines of text usually originate 
in the upper left and move toward lower right.  +X+Y on the robot
tabletop goes up and to the left because in mathematics, the origin
of a two-dimensional plane is usually at the center of crossed X and Y
axes, with the +X/+Y quadrant in the upper right.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Check the Velocity</h2>
<li>Velocity measurements are shown with a
green vector on the vex display.
Velocities (xvel, yvel) are shown in meters per second on the text display.
If your robot has a tachometer, the
velocity will display its readings.  If your robot has no tachometer,
velocity will be calculated as a differential of manipulandum motion
over time.  The green velocity vector will reflect X/Y motion,
pointing in the direction of motion, getting longer if you move the
manipulandum more quickly, and so forth.  If the green vector doesn't
move correctly, it may indicate a problem with tachometer software
configuration, or with tachometer hardware.
<h2>Check the Force Transducer</h2>
<li>
The force transducer is a hockey-puck shaped device between
(or above) the handle of the manipulandum and the "wrist" of the robot arm.
The vex program displays the force transducer
measurements in device space (brown) and world space (red).  
Device space is with respect to the force transducer device,
which moves with the manipulandum, world space
is with respect to the stationary workstation table top.
Force transducer forces (ftf) are shown in Newtons
on the text display.
<li>Hold the arm still (gripping the arm by the
"wrist") and push the manipulandum handle in the various X, Y, and Z
directions.  If all is well, the thin red vector will track Z
force (up and down the screen in Y),
and the thicker red vector will track X and Y force in
world space.  The thin brown vector will track X and Y force with
respect to the force transducer device itself.
<li>
It is possible that the force transducer may be working almost
correctly but it has not been properly biased, that it is not
returning zero readings when there are no forces applied.
In this case, you may acquire and set the bias readings, and then the
vectors should be zero length when you are not touching the
manipulandum.  (There is a slight bit of noise in the force transducer
readings, so the vectors will wobble a little.)
<li>
If the force vectors are wrong, this may indicate incorrect
configuration of force transducer channels, calibrations, or other
parameters, or other force transducer problems.  You may start to
diagnose these problems by working in the device space.  The force
transducer (a hockey puck shaped device mounted on the manipulandum)
is marked with +X, -X, +Y, and -Y.  Holding the arm still, you should
push the manipulandum handle toward each of these directions in turn.
Pushing toward +Y should cause the thin brown force vector to point
straight up the display, +X will point right, and so on.
<li>If the device forces look good and the world forces don't, that means 
you need to adjust the force transducer's ft_offset in the calibration file.
ft_offset is a rotational offset expressed in radians.
If the Z axis is flipped, it means your force transducer is mounted
upside-down, and you need to change the state of ft_flip.
<h2>Sending Voltages to the Motors</h2>
<li>
The InMotion2 system sends voltages to the motor
to apply forces to the robot arm.
Before you actually enable the motors to let the arm move in response to
power, first a word about what to expect you do that.
<li>
The "star" button on the "top" window runs a
procedure that moves the manipulandum between the center of the
workspace and the eight compass directions in a "star" configuration.
For example, number the compass points from 0 to 7, with north
being 0, northeast 1, east 2, and so forth.  Call the center point C. 
The sequence is: C0C1C2C3, and so forth, clockwise around the
display.
<li>
<b>Start with the brakes on,</b> so the motors will not receive voltages and
they  will not move the arm.
Start with the yellow dot right on the center
of the vex display.  <b>Click the green "star" button.</b>  The star
procedure will start a controller that tries to move the manipulandum
up toward its first target, the north spot.
As time passes, the controller wants the manipulandum to go closer and
closer to the target north spot.
Since the brakes are on
and the manipulandum is not moving, the controller will try first with
a gentle push and then harder and harder, to move north.
The motor force vector is blue.  If you have the yellow X/Y spot 
well-centered on the display, this blue vector should veer toward its
destination.
Motor forces (frc) are shown in Newtons on the text display.
<li>The duty cycle of the star procedure is 3 seconds of motion and
two seconds of waiting, in a loop.  Watch the blue arrow move around
until you understand what it's doing.  As always, you may move the
manipulandum around and watch all the vectors, including the blue
motor forces, reacting to the manipulandum position and now, to the
star controller algorithm.  When you understand the motion of the
vectors, <b>click the red pause button</b>.
<h2>Turning on the Motors</h2>
<li>
You are about to send forces to the Robot arm.  Please always be aware of
InMotion2 safety procedures, which include:
<p>
<b>
<ul>
<li>make sure that the robot is properly calibrated, by following the
steps above.
<li>hold on to the manipulandum when disengaging the brakes and
engaging the motors
<li>be aware of the location of the Stop button and
the panel On/Off Switch
<li>make sure the brakes are engaged (or the arm is powered off)
before rebooting, halting, or powering off the PC.
</ul>
</b>
<p>
Neglecting these safety procedures may (will) cause the robot arm
to swing out of control and may (will) hurt a person or damage the robot.
<p>
Note that it is possible for the vectors to show properly
on the display but the motors and
other robot hardware might not react as expected.  The
software code path that sends data to the display diverges from the
code path that sends data to and from the robot at some point.  So always
be careful even if the display looks fine until this point.
<p>
<li>
Turn the brakes off (<b>press the Reset button
and the green Start button on the panel</b>).
The star controller procedure assumes that the manipulandum is already at the
center of the workspace (and display) when you click the star button.
The further away it is from center, the harder it will jerk the
manipulandum toward that point.  (We should fix this behavior, but it
is not done yet and should not be a problem in practice).
<li><b>Move the manipulandum to the center, hold the
manipulandum firmly, keep the Stop button at hand, and
click the green star button</b> on the top window.
If the arm pulls hard or reacts oddly, press the Stop button
immediately.
<li>
If all goes well, the manipulandum will travel gently north, getting
to the north spot in 3 seconds, wait for 2 seconds, take 3 seconds to
get back to center, wait 2, then head northeast and so on.  If you
don't restrict the movement of the manipulandum, it will require
only a gentle amount of force, which will be shown on the display
as a small blue vector.
<li>
With the star procedure running, you may move the arm around, and the
physical feedback and vector displays should make sense.
<li>
If while running the star procedure, you hold the manipulandum
centered in the workspace, the blue motor force vector will be equal and
opposite to the red force transducer vector, because you are holding
it back with the same force that the motor is trying to push away.
<li>
If the forces seem wrong, there may be a problem with motor cabling,
channels, or calibration, or with the functioning of other robot
components whose calculations factor into the motor forces.
<li>When you are done running the star procedure, <b>click the red pause
button.</b>  When you are done using vex, <b>click the red quit button.</b>
</ol>
This completes testing of basic functioning of the InMotion2 robot arm.
