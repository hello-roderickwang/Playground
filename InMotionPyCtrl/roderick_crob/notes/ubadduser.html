<h2> Add New User to Linux System </h2>

From the command prompt, run
<p>
<tt>users-admin</tt>
<p>

Click <tt>Add</tt> and give the user a username and password.

<p>
Now log out, and log in as that user.
At this point, you'll have a default Ubuntu desktop setup.
<p>
Run:
<p>
<tt>/opt/imt/distro/imt-setup-robot-user</tt>
<p>
If you want a local copy of the software to modify, <tt>/opt/imt/distro/imt-setup-robot-user research</tt> instead.
