<h1>shm Shared Memory Buffer Program Notes</h1>

<p>
shm is a command-line program that lets you get and set data values in the
Linux Kernel Module control code for the InMotion2 robot.  This note
discusses how to use shm, and then how it works.

<h2>Sample Session</h2>
Here is a sample session of the shm program being run as a diagnostic tool.
The shm program is usually run by a script rather than by a person, so it does
not echo a prompt.  You may abbreviate command names to their first letter.  In
the following examples, user input is shown as <b><tt>bold fixed width text</tt></b>,
program output is <tt>plain fixed width text</tt>.  <p>

For a list of commands, type help (or h):

<pre>
# <b>./shm
h</b>
set name newval
get name
allget [pattern]
help
quit
</pre>

The main commands are set (s) and get (g), but for debugging, we'll
look at the allget (a) command first.  The allget command takes an
optional pattern argument, and gets the values of variables whose
names contain the pattern.  With no pattern, all variables are printed
(it prints about 150 lines, so the output is abridged here):

<pre>
<b>a</b>
get shoulder_angle_cal 0, -6.282840
get shoulder_angle_channel 1, 1
get shoulder_angle_degrees 2, 250.522327
get shoulder_angle_offset 3, -1.910401
...
get errnum 146, 0
get nerrors 147, 0
get error0i 148, 0
get error0code 149, 0
get error1i 150, 0
get error1code 151, 0
</pre>
The number printed before the comma in the get output is the index of the
command name in the commands array, the variable's value is after the comma.
<p>

Get all variables whose names contain the pattern "delta" :

<pre>
<b>a delta</b>
get time_delta_call 125, 64
get time_delta_sample 126, 62304
get time_delta_tick 127, 5007360
get time_ns_delta_call 129, 64
get time_ns_delta_sample 130, 62304
get time_ns_delta_tick 131, 5007360
get time_ns_delta_sample_thresh 133, 10
get time_ns_delta_tick_thresh 134, 120
get time_ns_max_delta_sample 135, 121680
get time_ns_max_delta_tick 136, 5208896
</pre>

Here's an example of looking at the scratch array with allget, then
setting some of the scratch variables to new values with set (s), then
looking at them again with allget, then looking at the particular
variables with get (g).

<pre>
<b>a scr</b>
get scr0 106, 1.234000
get scr1 107, 0.000000
get scr2 108, 0.000000
get scr3 109, 0.000000
get scr4 110, 0.000000
get scr5 111, 5.678000
get scr6 112, 0.000000
get scr7 113, 0.000000
<b>s scr0 0.11111
s scr5 5.66666
a scr</b>
get scr0 106, 0.111110
get scr1 107, 0.000000
get scr2 108, 0.000000
get scr3 109, 0.000000
get scr4 110, 0.000000
get scr5 111, 5.666660
get scr6 112, 0.000000
get scr7 113, 0.000000
<b>g scr0</b>
get scr0 106, 0.111110
<b>g scr1</b>
get scr1 107, 0.000000
<b>g scr5</b>
get scr5 111, 5.666660
</pre>

Note that allget is a convenience command for human users.  It takes a
pattern argument, and may print more information than you need.  Get
and set take a full variable name as an argument, so they get and
set precisely what you need - this is important when you are writing a
script.

<p>
To quit from shm, type quit (or q):

<pre>
<b>q</b>
# 
</pre>

<h2>shm Program Design</h2>
The design of RTLinux puts the real-time portion of a data acquisition
process in a control loop in a Linux Kernel Module (LKM).  GUI interaction
and file I/O run in a separate user-mode program.  Linux provides
several ways for these two kinds of tasks to share data with each other,
one is using real-time fifos, and the other is using shared memory.
<p>

<h3> mbuff LKM docs</h3>
Documentation for using the RTLinux mbuff shared memory module may be
found at
<a href="file:/home/imt/docs/rtlinux/mbuff.pdf">
/home/imt/docs/rtlinux/mbuff.pdf</a>.
Actually, I think the README file is a bit more informative, at:
<a href="file:/usr/src/linux/rtlinux/drivers/mbuff/README">
/usr/src/linux/rtlinux/drivers/mbuff/README</a>
<p>
The mbuff LKM allows two or more processes to share memory,
that is, references through a memory pointer in each process point to
the same block of memory.  This memory may be read or written by any
of the processes.


<h3>Calling mbuff_alloc and mbuff_free</h3>
The call to allocate a shared memory buffer is:

<pre>
	void *mbuff_alloc(const char *name, int size);
</pre>

Each shared memory area has a name and size, and the mbuff_alloc call
returns a pointer to that named memory area.  If the named memory
area does not exist yet, it is created.
<p>
When you are finished using an mbuff block, you must free it with
mbuff_free().  Exiting a program will <b>not</b> free an allocated
mbuff, you must call mbuff_free().

<h3>Data Structure</h3>
In most C programs, you declare static memory areas one variable at a
time.  When using a shared memory block returned by an allocator, like
malloc(), or in this case, mbuff_alloc(), you will want to impose a
data structure on the memory buffer that the allocator returns, as
this block may contain a group of many variables.  You may do this by
casting the shared memory buffer pointer to a structure pointer or array
pointer.  Then you may access the shared memory using C's -&gt;
operator, as you would any other memory.

<h3>How shm Works</h3>
The shm program allocates the shared memory buffers it needs.  These
are called Ob (general objects), Rob (robot data), and Daq (data acq
data).  Each of these buffers is described by its own structure that
contains a pattern of various types of variables.
<p>

Most of these
variables are 64-bit double precision floating point numbers or 32-bit
integers, either signed or unsigned.  In the InMotion2 system, these
data types have the typedef aliases f64 (64-bit floating), u32 (32-bit
unsigned) and s32 (32-bit signed).
<p>
Many of the variables in the robot software are pairs of
shoulder/elbow values or x/y values, depending on whether the
describe data is in the polar coordinates of the motor space or the
Cartesian coordinates of the tabletop space.  The robot software has
typedefs called <b>se</b> (for shoulder/elbow) and <b>xy</b> (for x/y)
which are structures that each hold a pair of f64 values.
<p>

If you are going to make extensive changes to the robot Linux Kernel Module,
you may want to put your new variables in a new data structure in
a new shared memory buffer.  Likewise, you will want to put your
new functions in userfn.c or in a new C source file.  Minimizing
modifications to the existing C source for the software will make it
as easy as possible to incorporate new versions of the control code
from IMT.

<h3>Getting a Data Value from shm</h3>
A typical need in a robot GUI program is to query the control loop for
the current position of the manipulandum (the handle at the end of the
arm).  This is a similar idea to getting the x/y cursor position
from a mouse driver on a PC windowing system.
<p>

The x/y position is stored in the daq structure, in an xy typedef
called pos.  You can assign the shared position variables to a local
variable in either of the following two ways:

<pre>
	// assign an xy structure
	xy pos;

	pos = daq-&gt;pos;


	// assign individual f64 variables
	f64 x, y;

	x = daq-&gt;pos.x;
	y = daq-&gt;pos.y;
</pre>
This is how you get to the data inside a C program.  But what if you
want the data from a script?  In that case, I want to enter commands
and have it return results:

<pre>
	<b>get x</b>
	get x 139, 0.123456
	<b>get y</b>
	get y 143, -0.456789
</pre>

To make this happen, we need a mapping from the string name for a
variable (like "x") to the mbuff address for that variable (like
daq-&gt;pos.x).  To do that, the shm program creates an array of
commands, called cmds[ ].  Each array entry has these fields:
<ul>
<li>size 
<li>name 
<li>address in shared memory
<li>length (if it's an array)
</ul>

The entries for x and y in the array look like this:
<pre>
        {so_f64, "x", &daq-&gt;pos.x, 1}, /* 139 */
	...
        {so_f64, "y", &daq-&gt;pos.y, 1}, /* 143 */
</pre>
In the actual program, you cannot initialize an array with a variable
mbuff pointer at compile time, so shared memory address is set up at
runtime.  In the shm program, these "command locations" are set in the
C function setcmdlocs().  The whole command table and setcmdlocs()
function are constructed automatically, using a Tcl script called
mkcmds.tcl, to make sure that they are correct and in sync.  <p>

Now you have a table of mappings from string name to shared memory
location, but if you want to find "x" in the table, you still need to
search it somehow.  Since x and y are at array locations 139 and 143
out of 150 or so variables - the table happens to be sorted alphabetically,
though this isn't enforced, so x and y are near the end - a sequential
search wastes lots of time.  The easiest way to search such a table is
to use a hash function, which lets you index into a table with a
string index, using a fixed-time function.  So now we can say,
array["x"] is daq-&gt;pos.x, nearly as easily as saying array[139] is
daq-&gt;pos.x .  We just use hsearch(), the hash function provided by
the Linux C library.<p>

The last step is to know what type of data is at the memory location
that is returned.  It may be 32-bit integer, it may be 64-bit float,
it may be something else.  The cmds array contains that type
information, so when we get the pointer to the data, we make sure we
get the right amount and format it properly.
<p>

There you have it.  You ask shm to get x, it uses the hash function to
find array index 139, it finds the data at daq-&gt;pos.x, and it knows
it's an f64, so it can be printed with the correct printf format.
<p>

Setting x to a new value is almost the same problem.  You read the
new value from the command line with scanf, then you find the data
location for x using the same method as in get.  Once you have the
location, you replace the old data with the new value.  The actual
assignment to the memory location happens with the somewhat fancy line
of C code:

<pre>
	*((f64 *)cmds[cindex].loc) = (f64) val;
</pre>

The parentheses and stars in <code>*((TYPE*)location = (TYPE)
value</code> are necessary to get this to work, when you have a
variable-typed pointer stored in void variable.  It's a bit messy,
don't worry if it's not clear.  If you are doing your own mbuff
C programming, you will not need this C idiom unless you use void
pointers to other pointers, which you probably won't.
<p>
<h3>Asynchronous Atomic Operations and Shared Memory</h3>
When you are reading and writing groups of variables in shared memory,
there are some times when you can do the I/O slowly and the operations
are still safe, and there are other times when you need to be careful
that a group of variables are all modified during the idle period
between a single pair of samples.  When such a group of operations
needs to happen without being interrupted by other work, this is known
as an atomic operation - the word "atomic" meaning here that you can't
divide it into smaller parts.
<p>

For example, if you are reading X and Y position from shared memory in
order to write it to a GUI screen, you probably won't notice if the X
is from one sample and the Y is from the next sample.  An atomic
operation is not necessary.
<p>
But if you are
writing a series of a dozen or more variables to specify new slot
controller parameters (3 for-loop parameters: init, incr, term; 8 box
position parameters: source box x1y1w1h1, dest box x2y2w2h2, etc.), you
don't want to have only half of the slot set up when a new sample
starts.
<p>

To deal with this problem, we write data that needs to be part of an
atomic transfer into an inactive copy of the live data structure.
When this write is finished, we set a "go" variable - the sampling
control loop checks this go variable during a quiet part of each
sampling cycle, and does a full atomic transfer from the inactive data
structure to the active data structure, when it's safe and ready to do
so.
<p>

There are such atomic write controls on the slot controller data.
There is also an atomic control if you want to modify certain
parameters like the sampling rate while sampling is running, but 
this needs further testing.
<p>

If you need periodic atomic access to data, for instance, if you are
collecting per-sample position, velocity, forces, etc., you will want
to use writes from kernel to user space using rtfifos.

<h3>Exiting shm</h3>
The only trick when you exit shm is that you need to free the shared
memory buffers that you have allocated.  This is easy if you use the q
command, but some users might interrupt out of shm with control-C, and
we still want to make sure that the proper memory buffer cleanup
happens.  To do this, we catch the signals that interrupt a Linux
program, and we also use the Linux atexit() call to make sure that our
do_atexit() function always gets called to free buffers before shm exits.
