<h1>InMotion2 Linux Kernel Modules</h1>

<p>
Starting an InMotion2 RTLinux program entails loading a suite of Linux
Kernel Modules (LKM) to provide realtime services:

<ul>
<li> robot - the IMT InMotion2 robot
<li> pwrdaq - UEI PowerDAQ A/D board
<li> rtl_sched - RTLinux scheduler
<li> rtl_fifo - RTLinux FIFO's (named pipe devices)
<li> rtl_posixio - RTLinux POSIX I/O (standard Input/Output)
<li> rtl_time - RTLinux timing
<li> rtl - RTLinux extensions
<li> mbuff - shared memory buffers
</ul>

When you stop an InMotion2 RTLinux program, these modules must all be
unloaded.  The InMotion2 system provides scripts called "go" and
"stop" to try to start and stop this set of Linux Kernel Modules.

<p>

If you are having trouble loading a fresh copy of the InMotion2
system, you should run /sbin/lsmod to make sure that none of the
modules in the list above are already loaded.

<h2> Why aren't the modules unloading?</h2>

LKMs are unloaded from a Linux system by /sbin/rmmod , the "remove
modules" command.  To quote the rmmod man page:

<blockquote>
rmmod tries to unload a set of modules from the kernel,
with the restriction that they are not in use and that
they are not referred to by other modules.
</blockquote>

From this statement, it follows that if a module is in use, it will
not unload.  If you are having trouble unloading the InMotion2 LKMs,
it's usually for one of two reasons:

<ol>
<li> a user-mode program (like shm) has a shared memory buffer
allocated
<li> a user-mode program (like cat) has a real-time FIFO open
(probably writing a log or reading a reference file)
</ol>

It is necessary to free these resources before you can unload the
InMotion2 LKMs.  You can usually do this by finding the right
processes with /bin/ps and sending them signals with the /bin/kill
command.

<p>

Killing (sending a KILL signal to) a cat will force it to close all
its I/O channels.  Killing a program like shm, that has mbuffs
allocated, will not force it to free its mbuffs.  The InMotion2 shm
program is designed to "catch" signals like KILL and other exit
conditions, and to make sure it frees its mbuffs before exiting.
If you write your own mbuff handling code, you should follow the
example in the shm source, and do the same.  Of course, 
you should design your graphical or command line user interfaces
to ensure that they clean up all the resources that they use,
including LKMs, before they exit.

<p>

This should cover the typical cases of the kernel modules not
unloading.

<h2>Remember to always clean up!</h2>
Whenever you program the InMotion2 robot, you must make
sure that you clean up all these kernel modules whenever you exit.
