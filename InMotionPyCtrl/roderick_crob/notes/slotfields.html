<h1> Slot Fields</h1>

<p>
Slot controllers impose force fields that dictate the robot's
motion.  In a typical slot, there is a desired position rectangle
(which may be a line or point), and the force imposed by the
robot is proportional to the distance between the desired
rectangle and the robot's actual position point.

<p>
In cases where it seems that the robot is guiding the
patient's limb to a goal point, the software usually
accomplishes this by either moving a desired point toward
the goal, or by establishing a linear slot with where the two
ends points  of the line are a starting point and the goal point,
and the line collapses with the back wall moving toward the
goal point.
<p>
The robot has a specific desired rectangle at each point in time.
The software recalculates the desired rectangle during each
sample period, usually 200 times per second.  These calculations
create the sensation of a moving force field acting on the robot.

<p>
While the images below attempt to describe force fields visually, it
is most helpful to actually feel their effects using the robots.

<h2>Point Controller</h2>
<p>
The illustration below shows the forces imposed by a point slot
controller.  The desired point is at the center of the image.
The controller imposes forces pushing toward the center point,
with darker values, further from the desired point, exerting greater force.
Imagine a rubber band connecting you to the desired point, and the further
you move from that point, the harder it tries to pull you back.

<h2>Line controller</h2>
The illustration below shows the forces imposed by a line slot
controller.  The desired line (segment) is positioned
horizontally at the ligher area in the center of the image.  The
controller imposes forces pushing toward the horizontal line,
with darker values, further from the desired line, exerting
greater force.  In a collapsing slot controller, the starting
point of the line would move toward the goal point over a short
time, creating a force that pushes the patient's limb from
behind, but allowing the patient to move freely ahead of the
collapsing force field.  Imagine a rubber band wrapped around the
desired line, and if you try to pull away from the line, the rubber
band pulls you back toward the nearest point on the line.

<h2>Curl controller</h2>
The illustration below shows the forces imposed by a curl controller.
The shade of gray does not represent a force magnitude here, this
is a more impressionistic image.
<p>
When you move the robot in a curl field, the field resists with a
damping force perpendicular to the velocity of your motion.  The
sensation is like that of walking in a stiff crosswind or trying to
move in a fluid whirlpool.  In a clockwise curl field, when you
try to move forward in any direction, you will feel a force
pushing you to the right.  The faster you move forward, the
greater the force pushing you to the right.  Imagine yourself
always at the center of a field that rotates clockwise
around you at a speed proportonal to your velocity.  In a curl
controller, as in a damping controller, there is no force exerted
when the robot is not moving.
