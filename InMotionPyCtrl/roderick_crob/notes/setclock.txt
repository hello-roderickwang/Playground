# If you're not running NTP (Network Time Protocol), you can fix the clock
# on your Linux system like this (assume you're root, and time.mit.edu is
# an RFC 868 time server you can reach):

# set system clock from time.mit.edu
# rdate -s time.mit.edu
rdate -s time.mit.edu
# set local hardware clock from local system clock.
# /usr/sbin/setclock
hwclock --systohc
# print time.mit.edu time and local system time,
# times should be identical
rdate -p time.mit.edu; date
