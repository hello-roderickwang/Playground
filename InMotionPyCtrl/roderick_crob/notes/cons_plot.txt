When you press the "Plot" button on the Robot Games Console menu screen,
a menu is presented with buttons marked as follows:

==============================
* Screen * Printer

* Position
* Time
* Phase
* Circle
* Z Force
* Custom

==============================

The top menu choice is for display device: Screen or Printer.

By default, plots are displayed on the graphical screen.  There is
experimental code in the system to plot to a computer printer, but
this code is not yet stable and is not available on most systems, so
choose Screen.

The next menu choice is for Plot Type, the types are: Position, Time,
Phase, Circle, Z Force, or Custom.

All plot displays have a file name label at the top that indicates data
about the particular plot, for example the file name:

/home/imt/therapist/test/therapy/20050301_Tue/oneway_rec_1_150729_Nt1.dat

means:

/home/imt/therapist - the home directory of the data
test - the patient ID - test
therapy - therapy or evaluation
20050301_Tue - the date - Tuesday, March, 1, 2005
oneway_rec_1 - the protocol - Oneway Record #1
150729 - the time of day - 15:07:29 in the afternoon
Nt1 - the segment of the run - North, To (center to north), #1

Times are shown in seconds
Positions are shown in meters.
Velocities are shown in meters per second.
Forces are shown in newtons.


Position:

The Position plot shows a set of up to 16 per-slot plots on one screen, for
instance Point-to-Point or Oneway-Record plots.  The display covers the full
window, and is labeled x position vs y position, in meters.  The name of the
set of plots is show above the plot.  Each of the 16 segments is shown in a
different color, and they are labeled at right, for example:

Nt1 (red)
Nb1 (green)
NEt2 (blue)
NEb2 (magenta)
Et3 (cyan)
Eb3 (brown)
etc.

There are 8 different colors, so for a 16 segment plot, each color is used
twice.

Time:

The Time plot shows eight different sets of data values for a single
segment, plotted vs time.  From upper left to lower right, these plots are:

x position vs time (red)
y position vs time (red)
x velocity vs time (blue)
y velocity vs time (blue)

x force vs time (magenta)
y force vs time (magenta)
z force vs time (magenta)
x position vs y position (red)

These are shown as eight small plots on one display, four columns wide,
two rows tall.

Phase:

The Phase plot shows three different phase plots for a single segment.

x position vs y position (red)
x velocity vs y velocity (blue)
x force vs y force (magenta)

These are shown as three small plots, two columns wide and two columns tall.

Circle:

The Circle plot shows a single display with five circle paths plotted on it,
that are results of the Evaluation Circle protocols.  The circles are shown
on a display of x vs y position, and are numbered 1 to 5.

Z Force:

The Z force plot shows a single display with five force tests plotted on it,
that are results of the Evaluation Shoulder protocols.  Force data is shown
on a display of Time vs Z force, and are numbered 1 to 5.

Custom:
The Custom plot allows you to specify which fields are plotted
on which axes.  For each of the X and Y axes, there is a choice of:

time
x (position x)
y (position y)
vx (velocity x)
vy (velocity y)
fx (force x)
fy (force y)
fz (force z)
grasp (force)

For instance, to see a full screen plot with time on the X axis and Z force on
the Y axis, choose Custom, and then "time" in the first column, and "fz" in
the second column.

Some plots are only sensible for certain kinds of data, for instance:

Position plots are for multiple single-segment data files, like oneway record,
point to point, or round dynamic data files.
Time and phase plots are for all kinds of data files.
Circle plots are for circle data files.
Z force plots are for shoulder data files.
Custom plots are for all kinds of data files.


Choosing a file name to plot:

After choosing the Plot Type, press the File button in the lower
left corner to choose a file to plot.  This opens a file dialog,
to plot the set of oneway record segments associated with this file:

/home/imt/therapist/test/therapy/20050301_Tue/oneway_rec_1_150729_Nt1.dat

Click down the list:

Directory:
/home/imt/therapist
therapist
test
therapy
20050301_Tue

and then file:
oneway_rec_1_150729_Nt1.dat

After clicking the file name, click the Open button, and the file will plot to
the display screen.  When you are finished looking at the plot, mouse over the
plot and type q on your keyboard, to close the plot display screen.

At the bottom of the Open file dialog, there is a "Files of Type" menulist, to
narrow the file types displayed.  For instance, to see only shoulder files,
choose: Shoulder data files (*shoulder*.dat).

To cancel the Plot operation before you finish choosing the
plot type, press the Cancel button.
