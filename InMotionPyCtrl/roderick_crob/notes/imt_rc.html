<h1>Setting up imt.rc</h1>
Tue Mar 12 16:36:13 EDT 2013
<p>

The configuration file <tt>imt.rc</tt> is a shell script containing assignments
to shell environment variables that control where the IMT robot system
looks for its software components.  Some of these variables specify
locations of robot programs.  Other variables specify locations of
directory folders that are used to store research and therapy log file
data that the robot software generates.
<p>
For typical clinical use, clinicians will not modify the standard software
system that IMT delivers.  The standard software system is stored in
<tt>ROBOT_HOME (/opt/imt/robot)</tt>, a read-only area of the hard disk.

<p>
Researchers who wish to modify the standard system software cannot
change this read-only disk area.  They must copy the standard software
system from the read-only disk area to a writable area in their own local
login directory folder space.  After copying the software, they must modify
their own copy of <tt>imt.rc</tt> file to point to these new local folders.  This will
notify the robot system software to use the software in the locally modified
folders rather than the standard software system.

<p>
This method allows many users to develop different sets of robot
software on the same PC, and also allows a single user to switch between
tasks which use different versions of the software.
<p>
The <tt>imt.rc</tt> file is invoked by the <tt>.profile</tt> at login.

<p>
After you modify your <tt>imt.rc</tt> file, you must log out and log back in, or run <tt>source ~/imt_config/imt.rc</tt>

<p>
You can check the state of your <tt>imt.rc</tt> variables by running
<tt>$CROB_HOME/tools/robstat</tt> .  If the system responds:
<tt>-bash: /tools/robstat: No such file or directory</tt>
that means <tt>CROB_HOME</tt> isn't set and <tt>imt.rc</tt> has not been loaded.

<p>

The read-only reference copy of <tt>imt.rc</tt> is here:
<tt>/opt/imt/robot/imt_config/imt.rc</tt>
<p>

The copy for user imt is here:
<tt>/home/imt/imt_config/imt.rc</tt>
<p>

To make a new copy for user andy, put it here:
<tt>/home/andy/imt_config/imt.rc</tt>
<p>

If user andy wants to work with his own copy of the crob and lgames
directory folders, he may copy them from the standard read-only
/opt/imt/robot disk area, to his own directory tree:

<pre>
cp -a /opt/imt/robot/crob /home/andy/crob
cp -a /opt/imt/robot/lgames /home/andy/lgames
</pre>

he would then edit <tt>/home/andy/imt_config/imt.rc</tt> , modifying the
relevant variables to point to his locally modified directory folders:

<pre>
export CROB_HOME=/home/andy/crob
export LGAMES_HOME=/home/andy/lgames
</pre>

Once you make this modification and log out and back in, the system
will use these newly set variables.

<p>
This is a list of the <tt>imt.rc</tt> environment variable names and their function:
<ul>
<li><tt>CROB_HOME</tt> - Robot control loop software, mostly written in C.
<li><tt>LGAMES_HOME</tt> - Basic clinical games, mostly written in tcl
<li><tt>IMAGES_HOME</tt> - images used by clock and squegee games
<li><tt>I18N_HOME</tt> - Internationalization code and some image files.
<li><tt>PROTOCOLS_HOME</tt> - Protocols mostly used by basic clinical games
<li><tt>ROBOT_HOME</tt> - Base of read-only robot code directory tree
<li><tt>THERAPIST_HOME</tt> - Base of clinical log files
<li><tt>LOG_HOME</tt> - Base of research log files
</ul>

<p>

This is the default contents of <tt>/opt/imt/robot/imt_config/imt.rc</tt> :
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

# This file gets sourced when you log into a graphical X session,
# editing it could allow a customized installation to substitute one

# out and back in for the change to take effect.

# This version points to the read-only /opt/imt/robot folders for clinical use.

# Items that are part of the IMT product.  You can copy the originals
# (with cp -a) to your home directory and modify that copy.
