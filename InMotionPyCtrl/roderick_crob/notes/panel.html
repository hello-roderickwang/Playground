<h1>InMotion2 Control Panel</h1>
Thu Oct 23 13:41:05 EDT 2003
<p>
<b>This note does not apply to modern IMT control panels.</b>
<p>
In normal operation, the InMotion2 control panel door remains locked and
all controls and indicators are on the front of the panel.
<h2>Front Door Hardware</h2>
<p>
These devices include:

<ul>
<li>ON/OFF switch - a two-position switch that supplies power to the
robot.  At upper right on the panel
<li>POWER ON lamp - lights green when on/off switch is on.  Below the
ON/OFF switch.  Not a switch.
<p>
These are in the middle of the panel door:
<li>RESET - red switch, releases the brakes, which makes a loud thump (if they were not already released).  Lit when
brakes are applied (at startup or when EMERGENCY STOP is pressed)
dark after switch is depressed and brakes are released.
<li>START - green switch connects motors to D/A outputs, allows motor motion.
Dark at startup, or when stopped by STOP, RESET, or EMERGENCY STOP,
lit after START switch is depressed and motors are engaged.
When you press START, you hear one gentle click, and you will hear some
continuous motor noise.
START does not work unless brakes have already been released by RESET.

<li>STOP - red switch disconnects motors from D/A outputs.  Does not apply brakes.
When you press STOP, you hear one gentle click (if motors were already
engaged by START).
 <br>
Not lit.
<li>EMERGENCY STOP - this big red switch applies the brakes, which makes a loud thump (if they were not already applied).
<br>
Not lit.
<br>
There is one EMERGENCY STOP switch on the panel and two others attached to cables.  Keep them handy. 
<p>
<li>Latch - keeps panel door shut, panel door is locked if system is
powered on when latch is closed.  The panel door has no interlock switch,
it is possible to bypass the safety it provides and run the system with 
the panel door open, but we recommend that you do not do this, both for
safety's sake and because the cooling system in the panel is designed to be run with the panel door fully closed.
</ul>
<p>
If the system error checks detect a failure condition, they will apply
the brakes and the lamps above will behave as though EMERGENCY STOP
was pressed.
<p>

<h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
Danger (Peligro, Gefahr, Perigo, Pericolo), High Voltage.<br>
No user-serviceable parts inside.<p>
Do not open the control panel unless you are talking with an IMT
engineer.  The high current necessary to
drive the robot motors may cause death or discomfort if you come in
contact with it.
<p>
Safety notes:
<ul>
<li>
You should never press the START button unless you are sure that the PC
is not sending torques to the motors.
<li>
You should never turn off the PC without first stopping the robot (make
sure it is in the STOP state, best with the brakes on.  Powering off the PC
may cause a robot control board to reset and send spurious voltages, which
may cause the arm to move is a dangerous and uncontrolled way.
<li>
You should always hold on to the manipulandum when you start the motors,
and whenever the motors are engaged.
</ul>

In case of hardware failure, if guided by an IMT engineer, you may open
the control panel door and if you are careful to stay away from the hardware,
you may gather useful diagnostic information.
<p>
Here is an image of the open control panel, with labels identifying its
hardware components.  These components are discussed below.

<p>
This picture illustrates the panel contents at the time
of this writing (May 2003).
The hardware components and their functioning are subject to change.
<p>
Note: the InMotion2 robot has two degrees of freedom, each driven by a motor.
<br>
The bottom motor controls the elbow link and is called axis #1.
<br>
The top motor controls the shoulder link and is called axis #2.

<p>

<p>

Power up the system by turning the ON/OFF switch to the vertical ON
position.  The brakes are already applied.  The PLC will emit two
gentle clicks as the system initializes its state.  The gentle clicks
come after about one second, and there is less than one second
separating the two clicks.

<p>

After power up, it is necessary to move both robot arm links (elbow
and shoulder) to register the encoder associated with each.  Among
other things, the notes below refer to system state changes that
result from this encoder registration.  You can hear two more gentle
clicks, one for each link, as the system registers the state changes.
Note that any motion of the manipulandum will probably move both
links.  (The system is now in the same state as it is when you push
the EMERGENCY STOP switch while the system is running.)

<p>
The lamp on the red RESET switch is now lit.  Press this RESET switch, its
lamp goes dark, and the brakes release with a thump.
The arm should now move freely when pushed by hand..

<p>
The lamp on the green START switch is now dark.  Hold on to the
manipulandum.  Press this START switch, its lamp lights up, and you
will hear a slight whining noise as the motors are activated.
Assuming that there are no voltages being sent to the robot motors,
the arm should still move freely with no command forces.  The robot is now
ready to have forces sent to it by a control program.


<h2>System Components</h2>
(See image above.)

<ul>
<li>1 trans - Power Transformers
<br>
Two power transformers, labeled 01T1 and 01T2.
They each have a glass fuse mounted horizontally at the lower front of the package.
<br>
No LED indicator.
<p>
<li>2 cb - Circuit Breakers
<br>
Five circuit breakers, labeled 
01CB1, 01CB2, 02CB1, 02CB2, 02CB3.  In normal operation, they
point UP.  If they trip, they may point down or may just be a bit
loose.  When these breakers trip, these devices go dark:
<ul>
<li>01CB1 - IO LED 4
<li>01CB2 - IO LED 5
<li>02CB1 - all PLC power
<li>02CB2 - most of the PLC LEDs off, but RUN,PWR,Y2,3 remain lit
<li>02CB3 - IO LEDs all off, these PLC LEDs remain lit: RUN,PWR,
Y2,3,5 and X5,7
</ul>
No LED indicator.
<p>
<li>3 gfi - Ground Fault Interrupt
<br>
This switch is labeled 01GFI.
It runs like the GFCI switch in your kitchen.  There are two
switches, the top switch is RESET, the bottom is TEST.  In normal
operation, the RESET switch is pushed in, the TEST switch is out.
If the On/Off Power Switch is on,
if you push TEST, it turns off the power (and tests the GFCI).
To allow normal operation after TEST, depress RESET.
If you push TEST and the system doesn't power down, the GFCI is faulty.
<br>
No LED indicator.
<br>
There's a ground strip to the right of the GFCI.
<p>
<li>4 pwr - On/Off Power Switch
<br>
A two-position rotary power switch, labeled 01MCB, with a stalk projecting out to the
panel door switch knob.
When the power switch is turned clockwise to vertical,
system power is on.  When the switch is turned counterclockwise to
horizontal, system power is off.
<br>
There is a ground strip labeled 01GND to the left of this power switch.
<br>
No internal LED indicator, but there is a green lamp on the door, and
all system function is an indicator of the state of this switch.
<p>
<li>5 cap - Capacitors
<br>
These two capacitors are labeled 01CAP1 and 01CAP2.
<br>
No indicator
<p>
<li>6 servo - Servo Amplifiers
<br>
The two servos are labeled AXIS#1 (elbow) and AXIS#2 (shoulder).
Each servo has one LED near the top of the package.
These LEDs flash green twice per second in normal operation.
They start flashing at
power up, and they continue flashing until power down.  At
power down, the LEDs flash green for another four seconds, then
flash red and quickly go dark.
<p>
<li>7 brake - Brakes
<br>
There are four brake modules, labeled M1A, M1B, M2A, M2B.
There is a red LED above each brake package.
Each brake package has a small button that travels in and out whether
the brakes are applied or not.
<ul>
<li>When the brakes are applied (stopped), the two B LEDs are lit and the
B buttons pop in.  The A LEDs go dark and the A buttons pop out.
<li>When the brakes are released (reset), the two A LEDs are lit and the
A buttons pop in.  The B LEDs go dark and the B buttons pop out.
</ul>
These LEDs light steadily in normal operation.
<p>
<li>8 relay - Relays, labeled 03ESR, 03LSR, and 02PWR.
<br>
No LED indicator.
<p>
<li>9 plc - Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
<br>
The PLC is labeled 02PLC.  It has an array of LEDs on its display.
There are two rows of red LEDs, the top row of eight, labeled Y0-Y7
and the bottom row of ten, labeled X0-X11.  (These are labeled with
octal digits, there are no LEDs Y8 or Y9)  There are three green LEDs
in the lower right of the PLC display, labeled RUN, PWR, and CPU.
The CPU LED sits slightly below the other two green ones to make it
easier to decode them visually.  The RUN and PWR LEDs light steady green 
during normal operation, and the CPU led is dark.

X2,3,5,7,10,11
<li>Registering the elbow encoder lights Y2 and and turns off X2.
<li>Registering the shoulder encoder lights Y3 and and turns off X3.
<li>After registering both encoders, these LEDs are lit: Y2,3,5,7 and
X5,7,10,11
<li>After hitting RESET to release the brakes, these LEDs are lit: Y2,3,4,5,6,7 and X4,5,7,10,11.
<li>START and STOP do not change the state of the PLC LEDs.
</ul>
These LEDs light steadily in normal operation.<br>
(there is a relay to the right of this PLC, labeled 06SSR.)

<p>
<li>10 i/o - Opto-coupled Discrete I/O Modules
<br>
The five I/O modules have a LED below each small red package, they are labeled OPT 1-5.
