<h2>InMotion2 Programming Examples</h2>

<p>
There are several programming examples in ~imt/crob/examples/ .
They should help get you started writing programs for the
InMotion2 robot arm.

<ul>
<li>xy1 - a command line interface Tcl program that prints position and
velocity data to standard output every time the user hits the enter
key.
<li>xy2 - a command line interface Tcl program that prints position and
velocity data to standard output once per second using an asynchronous
loop with Tcl's "after" command.
<li>xy3 - a graphical user interface Tcl/Tk program that prints position and
velocity data to the GUI window when a button is pressed.
<li>xy4 - a graphical user interface Tcl/Tk program that prints position and
velocity data to the GUI window continuously
<li>chase.tcl - a graphical user interface Tcl/Tk program that shows a mouse
cursor chasing an object around the screen.  This program does not access the
robot arm, you may want to modify it to get x/y position from the manipulandum
instead of the mouse.
<li>getpos.c - a C program that queries the InMotion2 Linux Kernel Module
for x/y position data.  Note, it assumes that the LKM is already running and
is not paused.
</ul>
